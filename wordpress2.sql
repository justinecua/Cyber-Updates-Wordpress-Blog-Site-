And they&#8217;re profiting off of the confusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnI-QcVSwMU\">I spoke yesterday at WordCamp</a> about how <a href=\"https://www.silverlake.com/people/lee-wittlinger/\">Lee Wittlinger</a> at <a href=\"https://www.silverlake.com/\">Silver Lake</a>, a private equity firm with $102B assets under management, can hollow out an open source community. (To summarize, they do about half a billion in revenue on top of WordPress and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/wp-engine/\">contribute back 40 hours a week</a>, Automattic is a similar size and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/automattic/\">contributes back 3,915 hours a week</a>.) Today, I would like to offer a specific, technical example of how they break the trust and sanctity of our software&#8217;s promise to users to save themselves money so they can extract more profits from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is a content management system, and the content is <em>sacred</em>. Every change you make to every page, every post, is tracked in a revision system, just like the Wikipedia. This means if you make a mistake, you can <em>always</em> undo it. It also means if you&#8217;re trying to figure out why something is on a page, you can see precisely the history and edits that led to it. These revisions are stored in our database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is very important, it&#8217;s at the core of the user promise of protecting your data, and it&#8217;s why WordPress is architected and designed to never lose anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WP Engine turns this off.</strong> They disable revisions because it costs them more money to store the history of the changes in the database, and they don&#8217;t want to spend that to protect your content. It strikes to the very heart of what WordPress does, and they shatter it, the integrity of your content. If you make a mistake, you have no way to get your content back, breaking the core promise of what WordPress does, which is manage and protect your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot of <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/support/platform-settings/#Post_Revisions\">their support page</a> saying they disable this across their 1.5 million WordPress installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-21-at-4.05.03 PM.png?resize=1024%2C864&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17787\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-21-at-4.05.03 PM.png?resize=1024%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-21-at-4.05.03 PM.png?resize=300%2C253&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-21-at-4.05.03 PM.png?resize=768%2C648&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-21-at-4.05.03 PM.png?w=1472&amp;ssl=1 1472w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They say it&#8217;s slowing down your site, but what they mean is they want to avoid paying to store that data. We tested revisions on <em>all</em> of the recommended hosts on WordPress.org, and <em>none</em> disabled revisions by default. <strong>Why is WP Engine the only one that does?</strong> They are strip-mining the WordPress ecosystem, giving our users a crappier experience so they can make more money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What WP Engine gives you is not WordPress</strong>, it&#8217;s something that they&#8217;ve chopped up, hacked, butchered to look like WordPress, but actually they&#8217;re giving you a cheap knock-off and charging you more for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the many reasons they are a cancer to WordPress, and it’s important to remember that unchecked, cancer will spread. WP Engine is setting a poor standard that others may look at and think is ok to replicate. We must set a higher standard to ensure WordPress is here for the next 100 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a customer of &#8220;WordPress Engine,&#8221; you should <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/contact/\">contact their support</a> immediately to at least get the 3 revisions they allow turned on so you don&#8217;t accidentally lose something important. Ideally, they should go to unlimited. <strong>Remember that you, the customer, hold the power; they are nothing without the money you give them.</strong> And as you vote with your dollars, consider literally any other WordPress host as WP Engine is the only one we&#8217;ve found that completely disables revisions by default.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"17786\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24:\"PDX + WCUS 2024: A Recap\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/pdx-wcus-2024-a-recap/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 21 Sep 2024 07:10:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"WCUS\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"WordCamp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17750\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:180:\"WordCamp US (WCUS), North America\'s largest WordPress event, hosted over 1,500 attendees from around the world at the Oregon Convention Center in Portland, from September 17 to 20.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Dan Soschin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18407:\"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"627\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/IMG_7364-scaled-e1726885354749-1024x627.jpg?resize=1024%2C627&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"I love Oregon sculpture at The Oregon Convention Center in Portland, Oregon USA\" class=\"wp-image-17751\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/IMG_7364-scaled-e1726885354749.jpg?resize=1024%2C627&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/IMG_7364-scaled-e1726885354749.jpg?resize=300%2C184&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/IMG_7364-scaled-e1726885354749.jpg?resize=768%2C470&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/IMG_7364-scaled-e1726885354749.jpg?resize=1536%2C940&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/IMG_7364-scaled-e1726885354749.jpg?resize=2048%2C1253&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCamp US</a> (WCUS), North America&#8217;s largest WordPress event, hosted over 1,500 attendees from around the world at the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/location/\">Oregon Convention Center</a> in Portland, from September 17 to 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over four days, WordPress professionals and enthusiasts came together to explore the latest advancements and use cases, collaborate on open source projects, and strengthen community connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A dedicated team of more than 40 volunteers, led by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell/\">Aaron D.

He opened by reading his recent <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2024/09/ecosystem-thinking/\">post</a> that explores open source philosophy, touching on themes of freedom, collaboration, and the ongoing influence of open source projects like WordPress. Mullenweg also critiqued companies for misleadingly labeling proprietary models as open source, stressing the importance of true open source licenses for the future of software freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt further emphasized WordPress’s ecosystem-driven development and highlighted the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future</a> initiative, an effort to avoid the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons\">tragedy of the commons</a> and ensure that WordPress thrives for everyone. His speech addressed community concerns about companies profiting off WordPress without giving back and urged attendees to support companies that contribute to the platform’s growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into the Q&amp;A segment of the presentation, Matt expressed the importance of recognizing:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“What we create together is bigger than any one person.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/DSC_7217-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Matt Mullenweg speaking at WCUS 2024 in Portland, Oregon USA\" class=\"wp-image-17755\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/DSC_7217-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/DSC_7217-2-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/DSC_7217-2-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/DSC_7217-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/DSC_7217-2-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg on the main stage at WCUS 2024.</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/ZSP_0761.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Matt Mullengweg and Brian Richards taking the stage at WCUS 2024.\" class=\"wp-image-17761\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/ZSP_0761-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C684&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/ZSP_0761-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/ZSP_0761-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/ZSP_0761-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1025&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/ZSP_0761-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1367&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Matt Mullenweg and Brian Richards on stage at WCUS 2024.</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Save the Dates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In his closing remarks, emcee <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/rzen/\">Brian Richards</a> expressed gratitude for the fantastic work the event organizers and volunteers contributed to produce WCUS 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian reminded attendees to save the date for <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025\">WordCamp US 2025</a>, which will once again take place in Portland, Oregon, from August 26 to 29, 2025.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"792\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/1000013801.jpg?resize=792%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WCUS 2024 Attendees gather for a group photo.\" class=\"wp-image-17753\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/1000013801-scaled.jpg?resize=792%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 792w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/1000013801-scaled.jpg?resize=232%2C300&amp;ssl=1 232w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/1000013801-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C993&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/1000013801-scaled.jpg?resize=1188%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1188w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/1000013801-scaled.jpg?resize=1584%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1584w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/1000013801-scaled.jpg?w=1980&amp;ssl=1 1980w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 792px) 100vw, 792px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Attendees gather at WCUS in Portland, Oregon.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No WordCamp is complete without an after-party, with this year’s taking place at the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/lets-get-social-at-the-wcus-social/\">Oregon Museum of Science and Industry</a> (OMSI).

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Music intro)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;Folks, this week is WordCamp US, and over the past week or so, I spent a fair amount of time talking to people about that first-time experience. And as with any person who&#8217;s talking about their version of a shared experience, I started thinking back to mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think my first experience of WordPress was not typical, though. I had never even heard of WordPress when I first went to a WordCamp. I think, I think most of the time people have heard of it before, but I was just there for the plot. So, like many people in my generation, all of us old people of the internet, I was first online with things like Angelfire and GeoCities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> When I went to college, I was keeping friends and family up to date on what I was up to with a little, like, newsletter? And then Xanga made it to our college campus, and eventually, so did Facebook. And I was one of those kids kind of like half-breaking sites with HTML and CSS I found online. I was changing layouts like every week to suit my mood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, when I graduated and found myself in a city with more talent and more competition than I&#8217;d actually accounted for, and started to realize that this online stuff I&#8217;d been doing for fun might actually be something that I needed to use as a tool professionally. So, I first went out and reserved my screen name everywhere I could think of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And we&#8217;re talking, like, LiveJournal, WordPress.com, Blogger, all the things, and eventually wound up building my first site on Weebly. And it was super ugly. I&#8217;m not able to design things. I have an okay sense for a design that is good, but like, left to my own devices, it&#8217;s gonna be what that was, which is like a tie dye background for some reason, and had everything organized into little, like, blocks, I guess? You know, like, old magazine layouts? And it technically had everything that I wanted, but it wasn&#8217;t necessarily the best version of any of those things either. I could write a little bit about myself and my services, I could add a few photos, there was a way to contact me, and I could do it all by myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it was a good place to start. Not long after that, though, I graduated into the need for a more professional-looking website, and it was beautiful. I received a website; someone built it for me. It was beautiful; it had this elegant design. Had a lot of custom functionality, but it was built using ColdFusion. I couldn&#8217;t do anything to it. I couldn&#8217;t change anything. All minor changes just had to kind of wait until there was enough to make sense to use that maintenance time, that maintenance retainer that I had. It really was just kind of formal. It was an isolated snapshot of all of the sorts of information that was required to be on the web at that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then, later that year, I went to my first WordCamp, and I moved my site over to WordPress. And for the first time, I had that kind of mixture of professional expression that was on top of something that enabled my own expression. And honestly, I didn&#8217;t learn much more about the software for a few years. It was doing what I needed it to do, how I needed it to be done, and that&#8217;s really what mattered to me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I skip a few years ahead after that, a few years later, when I was learning by organizing Meetups and WordCamps that had speakers that I wanted to hear from, that had topics that I felt like I needed to learn more about, what I remember most about that learning period for me is that I knew that I wasn&#8217;t the first person to run into any of my problems, which meant that a solution was probably already out there, and I could find someone to come and teach us about their solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And also, I knew that if we were running into a new problem and started breaking things left and right, there was always a way back. I was never really too far away from success. Like I felt like I might be lost, but I still was pretty much findable. And I guess I always want that for new users of the open web now, like new members of our WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want them to feel like the breaking of things is fine and safe and that no mistake is irretrievable. I want us to have some place where perfection isn&#8217;t the point. Now listen, I know the software is complex right now. The admin is a little mismatched, your first choices are huge choices, and there are a million places to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, all I can say is, start with what you need, and once you&#8217;ve got that, like the back of your hand, move on to what you need next. And keep doing that, bravely and messily, until what you&#8217;ve got is all you ever wanted. I&#8217;m gonna leave for you, in the show notes, a link to something called WordPress Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s gonna launch a little WordPress site in your browser. There will be no host. It&#8217;s just all in the browser itself. And it will have the latest bundled theme on it, Twenty Twenty-Four, and the latest version of WordPress. And that&#8217;s it. Go in there and click around on the left-hand menu. Start a post, change a page, modify the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just play around a while. See if it&#8217;s something that seems fun to you or valuable, or if it&#8217;s something that you can use as a time capsule for your kid because that sounds like a nice little mix of fun and work. And remember, sometimes perfection&#8217;s not the point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:57] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Folks, as I mentioned at the top, WordCamp US is happening this week. It is September 17th through 20th this year, quite a few more days. But that also means that we&#8217;ll have quite a bit more stuff to do. If you have your tickets and haven&#8217;t looked at all of the presentations occurring over the four-day event, remember to take a look at the schedule and pick out topics that are interesting. And remember, just because you picked it out before you went doesn&#8217;t mean that if you get in there and it doesn&#8217;t work for you. You can&#8217;t choose a different topic while you&#8217;re there. And as a bonus, if this is your first WordCamp that you&#8217;ve ever attended, I have you covered. You can check out my previous episode on all the things to remember for your first time attending a WordCamp. And we have a pretty active community as well. If you just have questions or want to get in there and say, &#8216;Hey, I&#8217;m going to a vegan restaurant for lunch; who wants to join me?&#8217; You can do that, and you can definitely find somebody. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, there are some upcoming WordPress meetings. So, if you&#8217;re not attending WordCamp US but still want to connect with the community, there are a ton of team meetings that are happening. You can find those on make.WordPress.org/meetings, I think. So really, really easy URL to remember. You can join your fellow community members and contribute to the WordPress project there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I also wanted to just call your attention to a few really big projects that still need a little bit of help around the project. So, on the one hand, we have Data Liberation. That is still a really big project, but specifically, we are nearly ready to start working on some user-facing elements of that. It is being powered by Playground, and because the data liberation, the migration of one site to another, is so complex, once we get those elements built into Playground, I think it also stands to fix a bunch of the problems that we have across our user flow, our user experience for the project. Things like having better theme previews and being able to get a sense for what a plugin functionally will do for you versus what it says it&#8217;s going to do for you. And getting a sense for what the admin looks like, all of those things. And so, anyone who wants to learn more about contributing to Playground or to Data Liberation, I absolutely encourage you to go check out those meetings, see what&#8217;s happening, and get your hands a bit dirty with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We also have a bunch of stuff happening in our community space. If you had received this podcast from somebody because they were like, hey, I know someone who might like WordPress or who has just learned WordPress and has never been to an event or any other reason that you are listening to this but don&#8217;t yet know the community, there is an easier option than just jumping straight into a WordCamp like I did. You can go to a meetup. You can see there&#8217;s a widget in your dashboard that&#8217;ll tell you what your nearest event is, but if you put your location into that widget, and nothing comes up. Technically, that means that you have an opportunity to bring a bunch of people together to teach you stuff you wish you knew about your site right now. So you can wander over into your dashboard and see those, or you can also head over to the community area on make.WordPress.org and anybody over there is happy to help you get started. And let me tell you, it is a very low-effort sort of thing to do. Here again, perfection&#8217;s not the point. And so that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there is a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Music intro)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It&#8217;s been a while since I talked to you about the digital divide. In case you&#8217;re a brand new listener, check out episode 17, and actually everyone, just go check out episode 17 because bridging the digital divide, teaching people how to embrace technology fully and how to make it work for you, is one of the primary motivators of my decisions in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> WordPress&#8217;s unique position as both a tool that&#8217;s ubiquitous in its use and a community that is all-encompassing in its skill set means that if you know a bit about how open source works, you can use it as a tool to learn digital literacy and practice technical skills. Even though this is one of my primary motivators, I have never actually succeeded at getting WordPress into schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not for lack of trying, it&#8217;s not for lack of interest from the community; it&#8217;s more that it&#8217;s hard to fit into curriculum-based learning. After all, we&#8217;ve had ways to learn WordPress for as long as we&#8217;ve had ways to use WordPress. It&#8217;s just that it takes a long time to design instructional material, even when you know the content like the back of your hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And open source stuff just moves really quickly. However, that didn&#8217;t stop us from spending years refining the content that we do have into the learning pathways you can now find on learn.WordPress.org. If you&#8217;re an educator, you can use those almost out of the box. But if you&#8217;ve got learners in your home and want to make a case for why their school should bring a little WordPress based digital literacy into the classroom, I&#8217;ve got five good arguments for you for why they should give us a chance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The first one, as I mentioned before, WordPress as a tool is practically ubiquitous. It powers a significant portion of the web, so it&#8217;s easy to find examples to aspire to and content creators for guidance. And given that it is so prevalent, knowing WordPress ensures that students are well prepared for a wide range of job opportunities in the digital industry, making them more competitive in the job market overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is that WordPress is a free and open source piece of software. In our case, it&#8217;s free in both meanings of the word. Free, as in no cost and no constraints. That means students have freedom to experiment with the code and with the design, which gives you that feeling of joyous experimentation that a lot of us had at the start of the web before there were CMSs. It taps into a different kind of creativity that results in technical curiosity and, ultimately, growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing is that the best way to learn WordPress happens to also align with the concept of project-based learning, which is one of the best methods for learning in general. I believe that to be true. I&#8217;m not an educator, but I really believe that project-based learning is the best way to learn complex topics. It&#8217;s an active way to learn. You get a bunch of tactical skills in there, like development, alongside the basics of good collaboration, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Obviously, these are all skills that are directly valuable in the workplace, but I have also found them profoundly useful in my day-to-day existence. You know, as a human participating in a society.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number four is a bit of a spicy nugget, but WordPress is essential for creating and managing digital content, which is table stakes right now. That&#8217;s a foundational skill for most web dev jobs, but also marketing, journalism, and communications. And beyond that, everyone knows that your best leaders are the people who can tell a compelling story based on the information they have. The ones who can connect the dots in a way that makes it matter to you. This is a spicy, of course, because of the confusing do si do that AI is taking with the content landscape. But I believe that people are the best storytellers, and stories are what keep us all moving forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing is that there is a whole wide world of open source. There are so many products and projects that use an open source license, right? Like you, listener, I can guarantee I don&#8217;t even know who you are, but I can guarantee that you use at least one item a day that has some open source thing in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And most of these open source projects are international. They&#8217;re developed on a global scale across numerous countries by people with various levels of education. And it&#8217;s this vastness of scope, this broadness of connection, that will give you, give your student, a chance to understand how to work across cultures, how to build something that is more than the sum of its parts, and how to embrace the concept of altruistic generosity that leads to a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Because just as I&#8217;m sure that you, a complete stranger, touched something open source today, I&#8217;m equally sure that the people we bring into open source will be able to solve the biggest problems of tomorrow with better connections and more skill because of what we taught them here today.&nbsp;If all of this sounds compelling, but you&#8217;re not ready to, like, go into your school administrator, your superintendent, your local, I don&#8217;t know, education board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this felt right, but you don&#8217;t know for sure, and you want a little bit more experience with it before you go advocate for it yourself, I will have in the show notes over on WordPress.org, I&#8217;ll have in the show notes of this podcast a series of events that are coming up. We have a couple that have already gone by WPCampus, I think just wrapped up a few weeks ago. But there are a handful of events that are happening across the world that is specific to youth wanting to learn technology, working with WordPress to get that done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then educators as well. You can also always stop by the Training Team and ask them questions about how this all works, why it works together their philosophies behind their learning pathways. There are so many ways that you can get answers to the questions that you might have about why open source, and especially WordPress, is worth trying to get your students exposed to and working in and contributing to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:52] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:59] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings me, now that I have finished with my little soapbox, to our small list of big things. Gosh, I hope you all missed hearing teeny tiny rants about WordPress and open source from me over the break that I took in August, but before you respond to that, feel free to respond to me in any comments. Let&#8217;s first get to the small list of big things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First up, the full WordCamp US schedule has been released, so if you&#8217;re planning to attend that, you can take a look and get your schedule, your personal schedule, for the week figured out. But if you&#8217;re still on the fence, there might be a speaker or two in there that tips the scales for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is that the WordPress Contributor Mentorship Program Cohort number three, the third one, will happen in Q4 this year. The call for mentors and mentees has just been completed. But you should keep an eye out on September 9th, I think. So, at the end of this week, the final list will be announced. This program has been excellent for mentors to give back to the community while enhancing their leadership skills. And the mentees who participate have received personalized guidance and a chance to develop skills and network within the community, and a good portion of them continue to contribute to WordPress itself and other open source projects that we rely on as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing is that YouTube has been an essential platform for sharing complex ideas with a diverse audience. And our WordPress YouTube channel is no exception. It has been slowly warming itself up. We have a team that&#8217;s warming up the content over there. WordCamp information gets on it now. But in keeping with our commitment to meeting the needs of both current and future users, just making sure that we meet people where they are, I&#8217;m excited to announce that Jamie Marsland will be taking on the management of the WordPress YouTube channel. So for anyone who&#8217;s attending WordCamp US, stop by and say hello to Jamie in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, finally, I have a really important call to action. So, we are still working to reactivate our meetup groups. The Community Team is driving that charge, and they need your help to reactivate any group that&#8217;s inactive. Last month, a list of groups was shared and marked for removal from our chapter program. And we requested responses by August 5th to keep those groups active, but due to the summer holiday, we have extended it a little bit. We&#8217;ve extended it to September 16th, which, if I am remembering my calendar correctly, is a couple weeks from now. So if your group is on that pending closure list, email support@wordcamp.org to let us know if you want to reactivate the group or if you are ready to step down and have a new leader show up, and we can help you figure out how to get that done. Either way, if you&#8217;re on the list, email us let us know what your hopes and, dreams, and plans are there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:09:58]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;That, my friends, is your small list of big things.</span> Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news.

It features a new navigation menu, eye-catching thumbnails, and search filters so you can explore and discover content quickly. The clearer and more structured layout helps you easily recognize the resources you need (courses, lessons, Online Workshops) based on your learning preferences. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introducing Learning Pathways</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This redesign also highlights a new approach to Learn WordPress content, emphasizing what learners engage with the most. The introduction of Learning Pathways lets you grow your WordPress skills progressively. You can start with beginner essentials and then work your way through more advanced concepts at your own speed. This method lets you build a solid understanding as you move through each course. Learning Pathways are geared toward specific learners, like people using WordPress for the first time or those interested in development.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=1024%2C730&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17591\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=1024%2C730&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=300%2C214&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=768%2C548&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=1536%2C1095&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?resize=2048%2C1460&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/07/1-learn.png?w=3000&amp;ssl=1 3000w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Four Learning Pathways are already launched and ready to explore:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/beginner-wordpress-user/\">Beginner WordPress User</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/intermediate-wordpress-user/\">Intermediate WordPress User</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/beginner-wordpress-developer/\">Beginner WordPress Developer&nbsp;</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/intermediate-theme-developer/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/intermediate-theme-developer/\">Intermediate Theme Developer</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can look forward to more Learning Pathways in the User and Developer tracks soon.

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;</span>Last week, we released WordPress 6.6, and I had a chance to chat with a long-time contributor and member of the Release Squad about it.&nbsp;Today, I have with me Meher, and she was, well I guess I will let her tell us what she did with the release, but at the time of this recording, yesterday we had the WordPress 6.6 release, codenamed &#8216;Dorsey,&#8217; and so Meher, welcome to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:05] <strong>Meher:</strong> Hi, thank you for inviting me. It&#8217;s nice to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:01:09]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;Why don&#8217;t you tell us a little bit about yourself, what you do in the WordPress project, how long you&#8217;ve been contributing, and then the role that you played in our big, big mid-year release?</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:19] <strong>Meher:</strong> So my name is Meher. I&#8217;m a front-end developer. I&#8217;m also a CEO of KDC. I&#8217;m also a codable expert in WordPress. I started with contributing into the marketing field. Then, slowly, for 5.6, I got to be on the release squad, learned about training, about how the release goes, process happens. From that time onwards, I&#8217;ve been part of marketing or, basically, I&#8217;ve been part of the marketing team for all the releases. For 6.6, I picked to do the Release Coordinator, something different, something new, wanting to know what goes into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That is a big leap from like hanging out in marketing to going to be the Release Coordinator. Before we get into the release itself, just what made you think to yourself, I would like to do that? I would like to stand up and wrangle all of these contributors across the world. Make sure we get a release out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:20] <strong>Meher:</strong> I wanted to try something new. Like even in WordCamp, each role is different. So, even in the release, I wanted to try each different things. And like 5.6, I was in documentation. Then, I was in marketing. So then I got used to marketing, so I stick with my, no, I stuck with marketing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:39] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:40] <strong>Meher:</strong> So this time, I want to try something different, and I want to see, you know, how easy was it to be a Release Coordinator because it&#8217;s a Release Coordinator, see, you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a like a big thing coordinating so many people so many different teams going on, working together, and so yeah, it was fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:58] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Great. I&#8217;m glad that you found it fun. I always worry when people make big shifts. I&#8217;m like, did we put enough documentation to make it clear? Are they going to find it easy to get started or not? And I think you did a really great job with it. So congratulations, since that happened just yesterday, less than 24 hours ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:16] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes, less than 24 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, yeah. So, from your position as the Release Coordinator, what are the biggest, like, one or two features that you really were excited to see get in this release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:32] <strong>Meher:</strong> Oh, one of the biggest features was the style override patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:37] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:38] <strong>Meher:</strong> Which I found very useful because a lot of people are using patterns. So, you know, patterns override; if you wanna change something on a specific page, it&#8217;s really useful then just to, you know, recreate a second pattern and then to match up and all. And second, which I liked as a user, was the publish box on the post becoming very clear, very, you know, cluster-free, very minimalistic, and just so comfortable that a normal user will actually understand what is there instead of going to each dropdown and figuring out what needs to be done. So, for me, I think as a developer and user, these two are the fun features, which I like, which 6.5 had, so. There are many other features as well. These are the two great features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I don&#8217;t think that anyone can argue about the importance of making things a little easier to see, a little easier to use. It&#8217;s been a little bit since WordPress was like fall into it easy to use. I feel like we have been the easiest of the robust CMS systems for like a long time. I know I said CMS systems. That&#8217;s like saying pin number. I know that the S in CMS is systems, but anyway, that notwithstanding, we&#8217;ve been the easiest of the complex solutions for a long time, and I think it&#8217;s always great when we, when we take a moment to be like, what could we make a bit easier to just like, no instructions required you get in there and you can tell like, what any individual thing will do without necessarily, like you said, having to go into drop downs and reading a bunch of stuff a little guesswork is okay. And also, it&#8217;s clear that none of it is dangerous. And so I think that&#8217;s, I think that&#8217;s a a good change myself. So, I agree with your assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So the style override patterns, that&#8217;s part of the suite of design tools that we&#8217;re pulling together, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:33] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> in your experience, you said you&#8217;re the CEO of your company, like in your experience, does that feel like something that&#8217;s super useful for agencies or particularly useful for freelancers, or should it generally be useful for everyone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:47] <strong>Meher:</strong> It will be useful from a small business point to a freelancer as well because we always try, like, in each page, we always, you know, there is some bits repeated, you know, so, patterns makes it easier, and syndicate pattern makes it more easier so that you can just duplicate and have one place to change. And, like, you have ten pages, you have one pattern across ten pages. The 11th page, you want the same pattern, but little change in that. It&#8217;s easier. It&#8217;s good because you can just change on that page, one particular thing and still go in the parent and change other things to reflect in that. So it will be very helpful for freelancers, small agencies. I do see big agencies take advantage of it. So overall, it should help everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Good. Good. I, for one, isn&#8217;t it great when we can get a feature out that mostly is going to help everyone. But I have been especially interested in the features that we&#8217;re trying to get out that help that kind of like small to medium agency area. I feel like we have a lot of folks in the WordPress community who do exactly what you&#8217;re talking about. You&#8217;re getting something together. You have a mostly what you need across your site. You have one style that&#8217;s out there, but there&#8217;s this one area that you want to have a little bit more personality or a little less personality, depending on what your client is looking for, like this one is applying for jobs, and it needs to be a little less exciting or whatever it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I think that&#8217;s great that we have that option. So you don&#8217;t have to try to, I don&#8217;t know, hack your way through that. I know that we&#8217;re not a super get-in-there-and hack-on-it sort of group anymore these days, but I love that we still have that feeling of we&#8217;re gonna, we&#8217;re going to make this a safe hacking space for you. Just get in there and make it work. So that&#8217;s excellent. Excellent. So for you, then, personally, cause you wear a lot of hats, you&#8217;ve your front-end developer; you&#8217;re running your company, you&#8217;re working, you&#8217;re a codable expert. You&#8217;ve got all these things. So from your perspective, what is the thing that got into this release that was a surprising, like a diamond in the rough for you, like a surprising good feature when you just thought it was like an important feature at some point? Was there one that seemed like it was a good idea but became a great idea by the time it was out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:00] <strong>Meher:</strong> Oh, I would say style variations because I did not expect the final style variation to be what it is. A theme developer can create the theme, can add styles, can add fonts, can give different design elements to the theme as a normal user when they when someone wants to just pull up a website, but they&#8217;re not good in design, or they don&#8217;t know which font to use. They choose which font, but then it doesn&#8217;t work. So if the theme provides an easy option just to shift the different styles they&#8217;re using and combining with the fonts. It is a much bigger opportunity for everyone because a normal user can just, they have a black and white site. I want to shift to a colorful site. Just go and see what the theme art has given you and shift it. So I think that I was surprised and I like the outcome. I&#8217;m sure my blogger friends also will like it because then they don&#8217;t have to depend on a designer to you know, give them color schemes and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes. Yeah. So unrelated. It&#8217;s only, it&#8217;s kind of related. I shouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s unrelated. It&#8217;s all about WordPress. And now it&#8217;s about color palettes. So, I have a new design on my blog. And unfortunately I am the sort of person that does need a designer to tell me what I meant by the thing I thought. <span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">And so, like, I had this idea of the sort of color palette that I wanted and was searching for color palettes inside themes, which I was not succeeding at.</span> And eventually I had a designer who was happy to help you figure this out and get something out there. And they got me something that&#8217;s absolutely perfect. It&#8217;s got an excellent color palette and they redid some images for me. So it looks nice and hip and feels kind of modern. I think it&#8217;s great. But the one thing that I consistently felt confident to mess with while I was in there, because I think they did some custom work in there too, is all of the stuff that&#8217;s included in style variations. Like, I&#8217;m not touching colors because I can&#8217;t put colors together to save my life. But I was pleasantly surprised also by that particular feature. It gives you a feeling of I can change the face of this through the fonts or whatever it is. And I think that&#8217;s a nice, a nice thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:06] <strong>Meher:</strong> And it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a perfect combination. Color and font. Because a lot of people don&#8217;t know today&#8217;s time which font is good. Or which font is needed for an industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Exactly. Fortunately, I&#8217;m a site manager of one. And so I just had to ask myself if I liked the font and moved on from there. So, oh. So, like I said, as we&#8217;re recording this, we are less than 24 hours past the release. How was your experience with this release? Was it enjoyable? Did it like expand your horizons? Were there surprises in how a release is run?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:43] <strong>Meher:</strong> There was no surprises because I&#8217;ve already been a part of a release. So I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:47] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That&#8217;s&nbsp;fair.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:49] <strong>Meher:</strong> You know, it&#8217;s depends on what happens on the day.&nbsp;But yes, behind the scenes, following up, just checking in to make sure, are we on time, do we need more time, or what needs, you know, how much more time is required. It was fairly good, I was only clearly concerned about on the day of the release, because there&#8217;s a lot of things to cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] <strong>Meher:</strong> Usually, the party of the beta and the RCs finish in less than hour or so. But the final has a lot more detailed steps and many people to ping, to get, you know, them on the day of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah, for folks who have never watched a release happen. So, I think a lot of the folks who listen to this podcast, they find it in the dashboard, they don&#8217;t necessarily contribute to WordPress. But, like, if you&#8217;ve never watched a WordPress release, we have these release parties for every beta that goes out, every release candidate that goes out, and then the general release. And I always find them so fascinating because, we have hundreds of contributors over the course of an individual release. And then we have probably 50, 60 people who show up at, for some of you all, in the middle of the night and are just being directed, like their attention is just being directed here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:06] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I love watching it because I, I&#8217;m always in the release channel. I&#8217;m in the core channel. All of these are in Slack. And then I&#8217;m also in the admin channel where you have to do the flipping of switches and packaging things. And it&#8217;s really interesting to see, almost like a scan of a brain where things are lighting up for various things. <span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">Like, you do the pre-testing in the release channel, and then you do the general testing in the core channel.</span> And then we&#8217;ve got like a person who&#8217;s flipping switches in the back, in the admin area to make sure that it all gets together. And it&#8217;s just really interesting to see how it all works. And yeah, it&#8217;s a really fun thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear listener, if you have never, if you&#8217;ve never done this, you have another opportunity. And I think the next release is early in November or something. And even if you&#8217;re there as like a spectator, not necessarily ready to take part in the release, sometimes it&#8217;s kind of nice to see how much effort and how many people are showing up to work on any individual release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:13:01]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;This was your first time to lead the release parties, though, right?</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:06] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes. My first time releasing a release party. Also, to the spectators who have never been a part of release, you can just come and say hi. Like, yesterday, on the day of the release, there was one participant who joined for the first time, and she did contribute.&nbsp;And she was amazed by how smooth it went through. And for me, the best part of any release is seeing the green tick when people start testing. So, you know, everything is smooth sailing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:34] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:34] <strong>Meher:</strong> And we&#8217;ll reach the destination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:36] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yes. It&#8217;s, it is a real testament to how well and how closely all of these folks can work together, which if you stop and think about the fact that everybody&#8217;s like all over the world, it&#8217;s all across the globe that this is happening. It is why WordPress works, right? All of these people, all of you coming together to do this on behalf of this software. How cool that you had somebody who joined for the first time and then they were able to contribute immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:02] <strong>Meher:</strong> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> I love that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:04] <strong>Meher:</strong> Also, there are a lot of folks who&#8217;ve done it. So they&#8217;re always ready to help out. You know, if you&#8217;re stuck somewhere, as a first-time release lead, there were certain questions I had. There are a lot of people to guide you to the right direction or to say, this needs to go here, or you need to tell the audience this. A lot of support you get from the squad itself, plus the people who are not on the squad and who&#8217;ve done this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:29] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Absolutely. I remember the first release that I led I was the coordinator of it and I believe it was 5.0. I believe it was the one that we put Gutenberg in core with, and it was the most terrifying thing I&#8217;d ever done. Not because I hadn&#8217;t been watching these releases happening for years, but because it&#8217;s different participating and watching and then being the person who is like you said, like making sure that things are still going on time that you understand when you need to say, like, there&#8217;s no way that this works for users right now. We have to take it out and all those things. And then, yeah, the day of, the first time that you have to run one of those global meetings, be like, &#8216;everyone, we don&#8217;t have time for this. Move on&#8217;. That&#8217;s always a really hard first time. Well, cool. That&#8217;s so exciting. So I have a last question for you, and that is, you&#8217;ve kind of let us into it, for first-time contributors to a release, especially anyone who&#8217;s thinking about joining the release squad for the first time, do you have any advice, anything that you wish you had been told when you were coming into this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:32] <strong>Meher:</strong> Come with an open mind and come with a thought that there are people to help you. Ask in any channel. There will be someone or the other who will answer you immediately or a little later, depending on the time zone, and will guide you to the right person or right documentation where you can read up because there is a lot of documentation, good documentation on releases, how it handles and what team is needed, what they are supposed to do. So, you, you have a friendly bunch of people. Just ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Excellent. I love it. I love that advice. That was really good advice. Don&#8217;t be scared. Everybody has answers, and they want to give them to you. I agree. That is a real strong truth for the WordPress project. Last thoughts: anything you want to share with the WordPress community with our community of listeners here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:20] <strong>Meher:</strong> Looking forward for new people joining the next release and seeing 6.7 new features, which I&#8217;m excited about, collaborative phase three coming into picture and excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Yeah. So you can come join us, make.WordPress.org/core, or you can join us in the Slack instance. You can go to chat.WordPress.org and get signed up for that. We coordinate all of this in the core channel, and we hope to see every new contributor that&#8217;s been on the fence. We hope you show up. There&#8217;s a new meeting every two weeks just for y&#8217;all. Meher, this has been an excellent conversation. Thank you so much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:56] <strong>Meher:</strong> Thank you for having me. It was fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:58] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Hopefully, you&#8217;ve had a chance to download the release and try it out on your own sites. As always, if you run into any bugs, let us know so that we can get them in the next point release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. I have a moderate-sized small list. The first one is that WordPress is a reminder, actually. It&#8217;s a lot of reminders this week if I get right down to it, but this first one is a reminder that one of our big-picture goals for 2024 was getting new users into our event series. Our goal, of course, is to warmly welcome more first-time attendees and new users, and future WordPressers at all of our events, and that&#8217;s something that you can help get done. So, for all of our event organizers, or if you have not organized an event yet and would like to, just so that you can meet the fellow WordPressers in your area or, get to grow your own network a little bit. We&#8217;ve got a few best practices that can help you to make sure that you have a good experience for first time attendees. For one, you should always consider some thoughtful event design. Craft your events with some first-time attendees in mind. You have to consider their needs and interests and potential barriers to participation. Second, it helps to have some targeted messaging. Ensure that you have promotional materials that highlight the benefits of attending, but also what new knowledge, skills, or professional connections folks will gain when they come. It&#8217;s also good to share success stories of past first-time attendees. And then just kind of a final note for that on outreach strategies. You should experiment with a range of marketing channels to reach professional new attendees. You can partner with local schools, professional organizations, and online communities who can help to spread the word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:52] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The second thing on our small list of big things is a reminder that the Docs Team holds an online Contributor Day every fourth Tuesday. They&#8217;ve been doing this for about a year now. And I think that it&#8217;s one of the most engaging and fun new contributor experiences we have, which I realize might sound odd for documentation, but it&#8217;s a great team. It&#8217;s got a great number of team reps in it. And they&#8217;re looking for you. They&#8217;re looking out for you to come and join for your first time on a Contributor Day. The next one is actually tomorrow, July 23rd. I&#8217;ll have a link for that in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:29] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And the third thing on our list is a reminder about online workshops. These are live sessions where you can learn alongside other WordPress enthusiasts, and they&#8217;re, you know, safe spaces where you can come as you are, develop new ideas, explore issues that you&#8217;re having, ask questions, network over shared interests, exchange theories, collaborate, and honestly, thrive on a bit of problem-solving together. New workshops are happening all the time. You can check out the schedule to join in on a live session and even watch some of the previous sessions to see if it&#8217;s for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And the final thing on our list is that there is a recap up of the first Media Corps Briefing that was held on June 27th, and it provided media partners with an overview of the Source of Truth and updates that were planned for WordPress 6.6, that was released last week. Obviously, we just talked to Meher about it. But that particular session featured guest Anne McCarthy, who explained and demoed some of the upcoming features and answered a bunch of questions from the participants. The briefing was recorded and published on the WordPress YouTube channel. Apart from the recording, you can also find a summary, the full transcript, and other relevant links from the link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px;padding: 0px\">[00:20:42]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</span> Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news.

Vacation was just a couple of weeks ago, so I guess I’m in the most perfect mode you can get in the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, the gray weather has really shown us that summer might be over. I think we&#8217;ll get a second wave, right? Usually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Yeah, it seems there&#8217;s going to be some cold weather coming. There&#8217;s something in Portugal that’s a special time of year in October, where there’s just this little extra sun coming in and warm weather that gives you a last goodbye kiss of the summer. And it seems like this year we&#8217;re going to have it a little bit earlier than October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, today we’re going to go ahead and talk about WooCommerce and hosting—the critical aspects for anyone running an online store in WordPress. And unlike a regular WordPress site, WooCommerce introduces, I guess, unique challenges due to the dynamic nature of e-commerce. Things like product catalogs, customer data, and orders, all of which place more demands on your hosting environment. And the right hosting can mean the difference between a smooth shopping experience or a sluggish website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess sales are directly affected by good hosting. So, I guess we could break down a little bit what our listeners need to know to ensure that WooCommerce sites perform at their best. And okay, let’s kick things off by discussing—we keep talking about performance here, Mike. I feel like this is the third or fourth episode where the word “performance” is going to come out multiple times per minute, or per episode. And I don’t want this to be maybe yet another episode about performance and how important this and this and this and that is. But having said that, the only—or not the only—but the main task of a good hosting service is effectively to provide performance to your website. So, performance is actually crucial for both the user experience, SEO, sales results, and all of that. If the store loads slowly, visitors will leave before making a purchase, search engines may rank you lower. So, it’s definitely a key factor in performance—the hosting, the server response time, and all of that. As a general rule, or if you had 30 seconds to give somebody good advice about hosting, what would you say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Pick something with enough resources, tools, and quality support to help you through any challenges that may arise as part of being an e-commerce store owner. And what you said is a very good list. I would add employee productivity. I have some clients who have 10 people in the backend processing orders all the time. That’s all un-cached, it requires a lot of resources and checking in the database for stuff. And then also business-to-business components—if your business needs to talk to another business, that’s fetching information, that’s going to require resources as well. I think, yeah, those three things I think are the most important. The support, quality tools, and resources. Without those, you’re going to be sacrificing some kind of quality overall, whether it’s for your users, your employees, or for your own, if you’re a stakeholder, profits and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Right, right. And when you say support tools, do you also mean the actual support service that a hosting company provides? Not only whatever you can get through a dashboard of some sort, but also talking to somebody—is that important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, definitely. I think talking to support staff, if you’ve worked with WooCommerce long enough, is generally one of those like, “Oh, how is this going to go?” moments. It could either go really well—you get someone who is enthusiastic and interested in troubleshooting together, finding solutions. And then you have other support staff who are like, “There’s nothing we can do,” or they try and point the finger somewhere else and are not trying to help you directly with the issue. And then as well as that too, it’s having the tools available to do troubleshooting, like having the command-line access with SSH, phpMyAdmin or similar tools to be able to investigate things in the database, New Relic or other things for gathering rich amounts of data. I know some service hosting companies have their own APM tool, and they have their own in-house scripts that they’ve built over time to help you scan logs and look for patterns and that kind of stuff. So I think both are really important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Yeah, that’s why I asked you, because in our freelance work that we do, sometimes we need to do the job of a good host support agent and sort of translate—let the client know what the issue is or might be—and just do a little bit of the bridge that one has to do between support and our client. Because sometimes support will say, “Yeah, this is this plugin that is running slow, this is this other thing and you should contact your developer” and stuff like that. And sometimes they’re right, but sometimes it seems like they’re definitely lazy about investigating the issue. But I think there are a couple of, well, this is getting better from time to time. I guess competition is responsible for improving all these services, and there are some really good ones, like you said, that have their own tools, and they’re very quick and immediately identify what the issue is, or being proactive as well—maybe mentioning that your website is running slow, there’s a long-running task occupying a lot of CPU power, and they go ahead and inform the client about it. All of this, I think, is super important. Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, you just reminded me, there are a few hosts that’ll send out emails if there’s been a 502 Bad Gateway or a 504 Timeout, or “Hey, we found malware,” or “You’re running this plugin version that has a known security vulnerability.” So, I think proactivity is one of the most attractive components of a hosting company, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />So I guess if we would begin establishing a list of all the things that people should look out for in a hosting company—well, besides price and CPU power and memory and all of that, I guess one of the most important factors is really how support works and what support provides in terms of service when things go wrong, or when you need help and when you need advice. So yeah, before committing to any host service, just try to figure out a little bit more about how support provides, because I personally think it’s probably the most important thing you can get. I mean, if the memory is low, that support guy will tell you, “Raise the memory,” and it’ll work, right? Or if CPU is not enough, “Add more CPU power to your hosting,” or this or that. So, it’s always going to end up being that support provides the information you’re looking for when you have difficulties, and managing hosting and leveraging what is the best plan and what I need, etc., is a decision that you will make today. But probably in a month’s time, or in a year’s time when your store grows, you’re going to have to revisit all of those choices again, and you’re going to have to fine-tune the hosting service that you’ve just hired to be more efficient for your successful store that’s running. And so that’s not that much important at the beginning, I would say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, I agree. I think, like I said, if you have enough resources and things are performing well, things are smooth, then there’s not too much to worry about. But hopefully, as the store is growing and being successful, you then have to adapt over time, and it’s really useful to have support staff at the hosting company who can help you assess what your needs actually are resource-wise and be able to accommodate. Every store is different. I think we’ve both seen plenty of them. They’re never exactly the same. There are always a few differences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />And when you see those pricing tables, they usually talk about the bandwidth, the CPUs, and this and that. And some of them do mention a couple of support services or support nuances, but talking to someone before committing to hosting services is a good idea. Or maybe asking other people or the community or any social media for advice on that. But having said that, okay, so now let’s see. We’ve talked about the support. It’s important. The different places where the data centers are and the different areas of the world the hosting service covers is also important, especially for stores. If you want to have a very fast-running store and if you’re operating worldwide, it’s important for you to know where that hosting service has its data centers so that you can expand your assets or different resources to those data centers. But let’s dive into more specifically really what’s important about memory, disk speed, PHP workers, caching systems, database optimization, security, backups, and scalability at the end. So, let’s start with the memory. I will just introduce very quickly how important memory is. And Mike, maybe I’ll propose to you this format: I give you a statement about what memory is and how important it is for WooCommerce, and you either agree or disagree with me and add your points to it. Sounds good?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Sounds good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Alright. So, if we talk about memory, why is memory important? We know that WooCommerce requires more memory, more RAM than a typical WordPress</p>\n\n\n\n<p>site because it’s all dynamic content. We have products, we have reviews, shopping carts, we have customer data. So, if you’re running a small store, maybe 1 or 2 gigabytes of RAM may be sufficient. But for larger stores and high-traffic websites, you would need 4, 8, 10, 12, 16, I don’t know, to run just to make sure everything runs smoothly. And without enough RAM, your server could become very overwhelmed. You could have slowing down pages and crashes, which is obviously the last thing that you want to have. What do you think about RAM? How important is RAM?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, it’s really important for sure, especially for the database. If you don’t have enough RAM, the database queries will time out or get terminated. And that can cause all kinds of weird issues where things didn’t get synchronized or it didn’t add to a queue that needed to be processed later. And then you also have some plugins that use a lot of RAM, right? So one of the things we often have to adjust is the memory limit in PHP so that certain tasks can execute. So, it’s one of those things you can’t oversell. On hosting, if you start to allocate more RAM than what’s physically available, it won’t work. And if you try and use virtual memory—if you remember back in the day, we would have a RAM disk and stuff like that—RAM is always going to be faster than hard drives. Even if—I don’t think SSDs will ever get—eventually, maybe SSDs will just be RAM chips. That would be cool. But I have a feeling that’s quite expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />And RAM specifically has to have the ability to quickly read, write, read, write in a way and at a speed that SSDs are not designed to do. If we would have a world where SSDs and RAM would be the same chip, I guess the only company that could be able to do that would be Apple. But jokes aside, it’s sort of like every one of these two components has its own job to do in the environment. You talked about the database and RAM’s importance for the database, but there’s also the PHP side of it. So, when you’re working with RAM, RAM is basically shared between two main things: the database and the PHP. So, PHP, when it runs, it needs memory to do its calculations, and when it’s done, it just serves the results to the web server, which then displays it to the client. So, having PHP tasks that also take a lot of memory is also important in this case. But that is fairly easy to measure and to know. And if you have a PHP task that takes a lot of memory, then that’s usually a bad sign. So, increasing memory to cover up PHP memory leaks is not a good thing to do, but it’s also an important part of the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Then we have disk speed. The disk is another critical factor, particularly when you&#8217;re handling large amounts of data. And we know that with WooCommerce we can get that. But basically, for WooCommerce, I guess SSDs—the solid-state drives—are almost always a better choice than the traditional HDDs, and SSDs are mainly faster to read and write data, which is especially important for large WooCommerce stores with, I would say, thousands of products or images or orders or customers. So having SSDs can significantly improve site load times, which obviously are crucial for keeping customers engaged. We are old enough to have been around to witness the transition from HDDs to SSDs in the hosting world. Was that the same for you? Thank God we already have SSDs for hosting. And did that, in your experience, provide a huge performance impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, I mean nowadays you wouldn&#8217;t ever choose a host that didn’t use solid-state drives. It’s directly related to performance and the database. You want the database stored on SSD, not a hard drive like the old school ones. I’m pretty sure there are instances where I&#8217;ve witnessed this happen, usually from very low-cost hosting on a machine that was older than it should have been for being allowed to be in the web hosting space. And then you move them somewhere that uses modern technology, and the client is like, “Whoa, my time to first byte used to be 15 seconds, and now it’s a second.” And they’re like, “I cannot believe that that makes that big of a difference.” So if you are lucky enough to find a client’s site that’s still using an old-school hard drive, and you move them to SSD, I’m sure you’ll see a significant boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />I guess nowadays, HDDs in a hosting environment are used for more static data or for large data sets that you don’t provide specifically in a dynamic way to a web server. They would be more considered for saving data files that are just accessed sporadically. And so you do see some hosting companies offering this large amount of hosting space for this specific use, and they are usually using… there is still this discussion around which one of these two different types of drives lasts longer, because SSDs are more prone to fail, I guess, than HDDs. But then again, we have bad experiences with HDDs as well. If you mess with them too much or if… well, when they’re in the hosting environment, nobody will touch them, but they’re also very sensitive to movement and heat and other factors. I do remember the time when we had this transition from HDDs to SSDs on our personal computers, especially for the people who had Apple computers in early around 2012, 2011, 2012, when there was a transition between HDDs and SSDs. And people were buying these external SSDs and putting them into the USB connection and just booting off of external SSDs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And some people also tweaked their computers and opened them up and installed the SSDs inside and replaced the HDD. And we got huge improvements in speed and suddenly the operating system was loading, we would say, it seemed like it was running off the memory only, there would be no hard drive. And I guess we can say the same for hosting. So files being read very quickly is a lot more efficient for hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, definitely. I do remember there&#8217;s one hosting company that they had… I brought a client that had so many images, it was like an Android news website, so they had so many images and they needed terabytes and terabytes. It was insane how much this was. And we ended up, because the SSDs were going to be so expensive, we ended up using hard drives in a RAID or something like that. And because it was just for the images—obviously you want to read the images as quickly as possible as well, similar to the database—but it was the only way that they could have sustainable long-term growth because of how much the image library grew every day. They needed something that made sense for the next 10 years at least. So yeah, I would just add to that. It’s an important little piece too. They still have their place, right? My Synology NAS, you have one as well, right? I chose Western Digital Red hard drives for the enterprise drives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />They’re designed to run 24/7 and also last the longest. I think SSDs have a limited number of writes, right? Isn’t that…?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Yeah. There are some calculations around how many times they can read and write, which defines their lifetime cycle, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Whereas hard drives are not unlimited, but it’s like, you have other problems at that point. You probably won’t be alive anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Exactly. Alright, that’s the disk topic. Let’s talk on another topic, and let’s talk about PHP workers, which not every hosting company discloses how many PHP workers one can get when we do a hosting plan with them, but basically—and I think they’re often overlooked—but they are a very essential aspect of hosting for WooCommerce specifically. So for everyone listening who doesn’t know what PHP workers are, in simple terms, they handle the simultaneous processes that occur on your website. So let’s say, for example, multiple users adding products to their carts or checking out at the same time. If you don’t have enough PHP workers, your site will slow down during busy times because there aren’t enough resources to process all the requests, and people are going to wait for their requests to process. So from the time that you ask for a specific URL and by the time you get the result delivered, that’s the time that the hosting will spend doing some sort of work, calculating some result for you to show on the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And PHP workers are essentially the processes that take that request, process it, run the PHP script, and deliver the page that they’re requesting. So those 200 milliseconds, 400 milliseconds, they’re going to be busy doing something. So if you have 10 people coming in, there’s going to be eventually a queue, and people are going to be waiting for their turn to get the process running, to get the PHP worker running. So if you think of it like a restaurant, if there aren’t enough waiters, service gets slow. It’s kind of the same thing. PHP workers are expensive for hosting companies, and they’re also expensive for the resources that you have on your hosting side, but they’re an important part of it. What’s your take on PHP workers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, I wanted to add to the waiter example that service will slow down, but you also get people leaving,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>which would be like a 502 Bad Gateway, where it’s like there’s not enough service, I’m leaving with a bad review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Which is what happens if a visitor comes to your site to try and buy something, and they just see an error message, right? 502 Bad Gateway. It’s like, oh, then they just leave. Some people will be patient and try to reload, but…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Attention is harder and harder to maintain these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Yeah. Why do you think most hosting companies don’t disclose how many PHP workers they have?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I think it’s a tricky thing to make equal because it’s very related to CPU and also the way that your site functions. So, I think it can be misleading to, for example, say you have 32 virtual CPUs and 500 PHP workers, though CPU cores and PHP workers, in my experience, are not created equally across hosting spaces. CPU is something that you can oversell and split. So, if I have 32 physical CPU cores, I can easily split that into 20 or 30 virtual machines that have four or eight CPUs, and it will just split and make them weaker between them. Whereas the kind of hosting I really like is when it’s a physical dedicated machine, and you’re not using virtual CPUs at all. And the PHP workers from that kind of machine tend to be way more powerful in executing scripts compared to ones on oversold VPS-style hosting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />And PHP workers, because they work simultaneously on a specific task, they are consuming CPU resources, and it’s sort of like, you would think, “Okay, I have four cores, so I can have at least four PHP workers, but I could also have eight PHP workers. We could split each core between two PHP workers.” But the more PHP workers you add, the slower they themselves will run because they’re concurrently running and doing their task. And so that will eventually also slow down, and you will serve more people at the same time, but everybody will get a slower response at the end of the day. So it’s not a linear thing. It doesn’t seem like the more PHP workers you have, the faster it will go. There are certain limits. So that’s why I think also hosting companies don’t disclose their PHP workers, because it’s a game of being the best performer but also not just wasting a lot of resources on PHP workers that aren’t clearly needed. And also there’s some sort of energy consumption concern behind this as well. You don’t just want to have a bunch of processes running all the time, so it’s kind of like a balancing game. But some hosting companies do provide those numbers, and they market offering according to PHP workers. And more isn’t always better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, very true. And it also depends a lot on the nature of the site and what it’s doing. I remember a client who did a lot of un-cached activity, so the idea was you would land on a website, and then they had a single sign-on system that you could connect your login to, and it would make an API request to a third party to authenticate, and then it would let you go shopping for some exclusive deals or whatever. We were doing load testing to get ready for the holiday season. It was for a very large company, and we found that they were running out of PHP worker threads. And even though we had a dedicated server with a huge amount of resources, and the CPU was basically flat, and the RAM wasn’t going that high, PHP workers were running out, and we were getting errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a long discussion with the hosting company to say, “Look, yes, we’re using that lane, right? Yeah, we’re sort of keeping a waiter at the table, but it’s because we’re waiting for information from—we’re taking an order from a friend who’s running late, and we’re just waiting for the feedback from them to give to the waiter.” So, it’s not like the waiter is stressed or carrying a lot of plates necessarily. Sometimes the PHP worker is not actively processing a lot of information; sometimes they’re idle and waiting for information to come back. And I think that’s an important part: if the PHP worker is not actively processing and you picture the waiter running around constantly, sometimes they’re not doing much. And it’s okay to allocate more PHP worker threads in situations like that, if you’re monitoring the system and you can see that it’s not stressed. If CPU and RAM are showing very low levels of usage, then you can ramp up the PHP workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the opposite way, if you have… I remember one of the first VPSs I ever provisioned and set up. It had one CPU core and 512 megabytes of RAM, and I was determined to run things on as few resources as possible and just rely on caching. It was a very cache-heavy website, it wasn’t a WooCommerce store, and I just kept increasing the PHP worker threads available, the MPM max children, and you can put it as high as you want. But then when I did load testing for un-cached responses, the server froze completely. And when I SSH’d in, the load number was like 200 and something, which it should be as close to 1 or 1 times the number of CPU cores that you have. You could just imagine these poor waiters, there was a lot of very, very tiny waiters carrying a lot of stuff, and none of them knew where they were going anymore. They were all confused, and the queue just got so backed up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />I would imagine if this podcast included video, we would put up a graphic of tiny waiters in multiple restaurants just running around and being unorganized, and it would be very interesting to visualize that. I completely forgot. So, we’ve been talking about the importance of RAM and disk space and PHP workers, but not naming numbers. So I will try to give people a little bit of some ideas of what the numbers are for each of these individual components. Let’s call them, and I’ll name some numbers, and you correct me if I’m good with my numbers or not. But this is basically the same thing with engines in a car. If you have BMW, for example, they’re famous for having these big engines, they have 3 liters, 4-liter engines, and you just throw a bunch of gasoline in it. The explosion is huge. They have thick engine walls that can handle all the explosion. Then you have superpower, you have a lot of power because you really just have thick walls and a lot of gasoline exploding inside those cylinders. So that’s one way to do it. Let’s call it the easy way. It’s not an easy way to have a very big controlled explosion inside a cylinder, but let’s call it easy. The more tricky way is to have a 1-liter engine or a 1.5-liter engine and have an explosion that has almost the same kind of force or power that has this bigger explosion, but because you&#8217;ve adapted the shape of the cylinder, but because you made a special mixture between air and combustion and all of that, because you took a little bit more time into figuring out how to almost get the same kind of force with a lot less energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess that’s a little bit the comparison that we’re making here. You can obviously have 16 GB of RAM and 16 CPUs and a lot of disk space and everything will run smoothly, yes. But is that efficient? Do you need all of that? Are you using your BMW to drive 5 kilometers to take your kid to school, or do you drive 300 kilometers every day and really need that strong engine to work in your favor? So, having that in mind, and taking into consideration that everything is running smoothly—you don’t have custom code that is just occupying a lot of resources—I would say less than 50 concurrent users, 2 gigabytes of RAM is enough. If you have 100 to 200 concurrent users, I think 4 gigabytes. And more than 200 concurrent users, it’d be 8+ to 16 gigabytes. I think these are good numbers. Would you agree with these numbers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I think those are probably safe starting points, assuming the database is not huge. That would be my one caveat. If you have a 20-gigabyte database, then you’re going to want to start with at least 32 GB of RAM, I’d say, or more. But yeah, and then load tests—now people are getting prepared for the holiday season, Black Friday is coming up, and I would load test the most resource-hungry scenarios you can think of in terms of the marketing stuff you’re doing, whether it’s newsletters or paid traffic on Meta or Google or whatever it is. And we’re doing something right now with a client, and once they get to 200 users, things are not going well. So, we’re identifying the bottlenecks with New Relic and coming up with strategies of how to mitigate them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />And the strategy is definitely not just, “Okay, let’s just double the RAM and everything will be good,” right? Because that’s also a cost that people have to take into consideration. You don’t have infinite money to pay for these resources and just be happy with it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, I think during the holiday season is when people tend to be more open to the idea of just throwing resources at the problem. It’s certainly the easiest solution. Even if it costs more, usually it’s going to be worth it. If your site is crashing, you’re not making as much money, for sure. But yeah</p>\n\n\n\n<p>, in general, I don’t like the idea of, “Oh, just keep throwing resources at it until it works properly.” I think you and I would go and identify what is taking so long. Is the code optimized correctly? Is there a way to rewrite it so it’s more efficient in processing data and using less RAM and stuff like that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />And it’s a lot more intelligent and rewarding if you figure out what’s consuming that much resource, and then suddenly, with the same kind of resources, the website’s speed doubles. There’s something special about tuning that, right? Obviously, if you&#8217;re time-constrained, and the holiday season is coming, then okay, let’s add some more RAM for the next three months, and then we’ll figure it out later, fine. But the figuring out later part needs to happen sometime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, websites are just like a house or an F1 car. You can’t just keep adding stuff to it or turning something on and forgetting you left it on. If you have a basement and you turn the water on to do some sort of task, and then you got distracted and left it on, you’re adding more and more resources to accommodate a flood that you don’t need for any business purposes. I think that’s really important because a lot of the times when I do investigations, the thing that’s gobbling up CPU or RAM or disk space is a feature that they tested once upon a time and no longer use. The person at the company who suggested it is no longer with the company or whatever. So, I think this sort of website hygiene maintenance stuff is just so, so important. Also, hosting companies can help you with that, right? Good hosting companies will tell you if you’re about to run out of hosting, sorry, disk space, because without disk space, nothing will work. You won’t be able to do database operations, you won’t be able to log into your WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />You might not even be able to SSH into your hosting and do anything in there, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, you can usually SSH in, but running commands will just give you weird output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />And the same thing with RAM, right? If you run out of RAM and you need just a little extra to run some command to just basically kill something or fix something, it’s the same thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah. You can SSH in, but running commands will just give you weird output. It’s a funny experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />And as far as CPUs are concerned, for 50 concurrent users, I’d say 2 CPUs, for 100 to 200 concurrent users, 4 CPUs, and for more than 200 concurrent users, you’ll need 8 CPUs. I would say that’s a round number or more depending on the situation. Would you agree with those numbers as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />In general, I’d say they’re probably good starting points. It’s going to depend again on how many of those people are window shopping versus adding items to their cart. I think if you have caching set up properly and you don’t have a huge product catalog where every user is visiting different products, you can have tons—you could have hundreds or even thousands of window shoppers. But as soon as people start adding items to their cart, then the majority of caches are bypassed. Depending on how your site is tuned, we’ve seen this plenty of times where code is running unnecessarily for uncached visitors. WordPress runs a lot of functions, plugins execute a lot of code that doesn’t need to be, and that can slow things down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />And as far as PHP workers are concerned, I would say on the same scale—50 concurrent users, 2 PHP workers; 100 to 200 concurrent users, 4 PHP workers; and more than 200, 10 PHP workers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, you could start with those and see what happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Let’s talk about the big elephant in the room—caching systems. Caching is definitely one of the most effective ways to improve the performance of an eCommerce store. There are different types of caching. There’s page caching, which saves a static version of your website. But we all know that WooCommerce stores can only have so many static versions of pages. Not all pages can be static like on a regular site, and those will be delivered without making your server do all the work from scratch. Right? Then you have object caching, you have Redis cache, you have… those would help you with database queries. You have browser caching, so the client side can also do some caching to save the resources locally on the user’s devices. You have OPCache or code caching, and you have a bunch of different caching systems to reduce the load on the server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was thinking about asking you this question—how important is caching to you? But it seems like a silly question. I would rather ask you about the experience that you’ve been having with your most recent clients. Taking into consideration that hosting can provide some caching solutions, and based on the hosting services you&#8217;ve worked with, do you think there’s a hosting service that really nails the caching system for WooCommerce?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I would say it’s really difficult to do it perfectly because all stores are different. So, the best you can really expect from a hosting company is that they provide the tools and configuration possibilities necessary to set up caching correctly for your site. Most hosts do a decent job of setting up things where the cart and checkout are excluded, and they make sure the right cookies are excluded, like the ones for items in the cart. Edge caching is becoming more popular now, thanks to Cloudflare Enterprise integration, which is becoming easier. You get to take advantage of that, which reduces time-to-first-byte across different locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, no hosting company gets it perfectly right, but a lot of them offer a good starting point, a springboard, so you can configure caching yourself. I saw one hosting company recently that helped their client cache logged-in users for a Woo store, which I thought was really clever. Caching logged-in users sounds like dark magic, but their business model required users to register an account and log in to see the product catalog. Everything else was uncached, but once they logged in, they had a custom system where a cookie allowed for logged-in pages to be cached. It was really clever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a special use case, and I wouldn’t expect every hosting company to offer that, but it was a great example of a very customized solution that worked well. Usually, though, it’s a balance of having good tools and knowing how to use them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />The thing that’s special about WooCommerce is that some of the pages cannot be cached in the same way that other pages can. So, the least a hosting company needs to be aware of when offering WooCommerce-specialized hosting services is that there are certain pages within the WooCommerce store environment that need to be treated differently. You might also have custom pages where you want to insert exclusions for certain types of caching. Caching needs to be adapted to the nature of the store, not only for WooCommerce generally, but also for your own unique needs. I think that’s an important part of choosing a hosting provider. If you know they have the capability to adapt to your needs, that’s crucial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yeah, hosting services are getting better at accommodating those requests. If you have the knowledge, you can still go to AWS or Google Cloud and configure everything yourself, but most store owners don’t have the time or expertise for that. Thankfully, many of these caching techniques are now available through hosting companies, and they take care of a lot under the hood. So, it’s definitely something to look for when choosing a host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s talk very quickly about database optimization. This is one that site owners often overlook. Since WooCommerce stores store a lot of data, and we talked about this in our previous episode, everything from customer and order history… your database can get bloated, and that can slow things down. Regularly optimizing the database by removing transients or optimizing tables can make a big difference in performance. There are plugins that can help with that, and some hosting providers might also offer database optimization services. In 30 seconds, because I want to get to the end of the topics I have, Mike, how important is database optimization?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I think it’s similar to disk space and other stuff. If you don’t have an optimized database, everything is slower. Especially with WooCommerce, where the post table holds so much data, things can get really bloated. If your database is cluttered with unnecessary data, queries take longer, and that can impact performance. So yeah, it’s critical. Optimizing the database is not an optional thing. It’s like a house—if things are disorganized, or if there are too many of the same item in one drawer, it’s hard to find what you need. The same applies to your database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />And also, I would say if people want to know more about database and performance optimization, they should check out our previous episode here on <em>Do the Woo</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let’s talk security and backups. Security is vital, obviously, since you&#8217;re handling customer data and payments. So, there are a couple of measures that hosting providers take to provide more security. SSL is mandatory—there&#8217;s not even a need to discuss that. But backups are also very important, and backups can be tricky. If you have a store that’s running 24/7 and you have a lot of orders coming in, if something happens and you need to restore a database, you’re going to lose some data unless you have a smart backup system. Some automated backup systems are more clever than others, but that’s definitely something to keep in mind. Your hosting provider will help a lot if they take care of that. Would you agree, Mike?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yes, absolutely. Backups are crucial. Hosting companies need to have quick, reliable backups, and the ability to restore them quickly. And backups should not take hours and hours to complete unless your database is absolutely massive. But without a proper backup and restore plan in place, you’re in trouble if something goes wrong. Hourly backups, for example, can be a lifesaver, especially for stores that have a lot of transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, good hosting companies will take a snapshot before you restore a backup. In case you made a mistake or restored the wrong version, you can roll it back. It’s important to have that safety net.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Right. And snapshots are very useful. Having backups done quickly is important, but knowing how to restore them is just as important. You need to be able to get your site back up quickly if something goes wrong, and that’s where good hosting support comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I would also say verifying that your backups are actually valid and work should be part of every store&#8217;s maintenance. Test your backups periodically to make sure they restore properly. You don&#8217;t want to find out when something goes wrong that your backups were incomplete or corrupted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Exactly. It’s like a fire drill. You need to run it once or twice a year to make sure everything works as expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, let’s talk about scalability. When your WooCommerce store grows, you’ll need to scale it. You might start with shared hosting, which we haven’t really mentioned in this episode, but as your traffic increases, you might need to upgrade to a VPS or even a dedicated server for larger businesses. Usually, companies use AWS or Google Cloud because they allow you to scale resources up and down easily. It’s important to choose a hosting provider that can grow with your store, so you’re not stuck with limits that could hurt your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How important do you think it is when people start out to choose a hosting company that can scale? Or do you think there are hosts that are</p>\n\n\n\n<p>better suited for different stages of a business’s growth?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />That’s a good question. I think it’s always a good idea to bet on your own success. You should anticipate growth unless you&#8217;re sure that your business model is limited and won’t require much scaling. It’s important to choose a hosting company that can grow with you. I’m sure you’ve experienced this too—migrating a WooCommerce store from one hosting platform to another is a nerve-wracking experience for clients. Many people have had bad experiences with migrations, and it can be traumatic if something goes wrong. So, it’s better to start with a hosting company that offers both shared hosting and scalable options like VPS and dedicated servers. You want to be able to grow without needing to change hosts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Exactly. And we fall back to what we talked about earlier—support is key. When you hit a threshold and need to upgrade, you want the hosting company to handle that transition smoothly. If you have a hosting provider that says, “Unfortunately, now you need to do this and that,” and they just put the whole thing back on the client, that’s not a good service. When scaling, the hosting company should be a partner in that process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, they should say, “Hey, you&#8217;re growing. Shared hosting is not an option anymore. Don&#8217;t worry. Let&#8217;s schedule a migration during your least busy hours, and by tomorrow morning when you wake up, you&#8217;ll have a new hosting service that can accommodate your growth.” That&#8217;s the kind of hosting service you want, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, definitely. When we’re offering advice to clients, we usually want them to be prepared for the next 10 to 20 years with whatever challenges or growth opportunities they may face. We have a handful of hosting providers we know can accommodate different types of stores and business models, so they will scale as needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to find hosts that can do horizontal scaling—multiple servers. Usually, once you&#8217;ve added a domain name that maps to a specific server, you can’t add another. Vertical scaling is more common; they’re happy to let you resize your server and make it bigger. But some clients want parallel processing or geo-redundancy. I have one client that has servers in Chicago and New Jersey, with a primary and secondary database setup. If Chicago goes down, New Jersey takes over. Not every host supports that kind of infrastructure, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />There are two other things I want to add before we wrap up: bandwidth and monitoring tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bandwidth is something people need to keep an eye on, even though most hosting providers offer scalable or unlimited bandwidth. But you should calculate your bandwidth needs by taking the average page size and multiplying it by the number of visitors and pages viewed. For example, if your average page size is 2MB, and you get 5,000 visitors per month, each viewing five pages on average, you&#8217;re looking at 50GB of bandwidth a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven’t had a client run into bandwidth limits recently, but it’s still something to watch out for. Have you seen any issues with bandwidth?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />No, not in recent years. Most hosting providers have moved toward offering unlimited bandwidth, especially since many use Cloudflare to handle some of the load. I see more issues with outgoing emails being rate-limited, though. Some hosts will restrict the number of outgoing emails, especially if they think there’s suspicious activity, like a flood of order confirmation emails during a sale. It’s not great if you&#8217;re running a big sale and your emails are getting blocked, because customers start to wonder where their order confirmation is. That leads to support tickets and frustration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Right, good point. And finally, monitoring. As a developer, I really appreciate hosting companies that provide good monitoring tools. I’m talking about dashboards where you can see CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, PHP workers, and even bandwidth. Some hosts offer integration with tools like New Relic, or they have their own monitoring tools. It’s important to be able to check on your website’s health regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing a developer or freelancer will ask a client is, “Do you have a staging website?” If your hosting provider allows you to spin up low-end environments like staging or performance environments, it’s incredibly helpful. You don&#8217;t need production-level power for staging, but you do need an environment to test things. And most hosting providers do offer them, but not all of them are free. So, having that capability without extra charges is key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />I completely agree. As developers, we’re always asking for a staging environment. It’s the first thing we ask before making any significant changes. Having a staging site on the same host is crucial for testing updates, new features, or troubleshooting problems without affecting the live site. And yes, it shouldn’t be expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monitoring is also essential. The good hosting companies will provide a robust dashboard with real-time stats. And if you’re using New Relic or similar tools, you can get deep insights into performance, slow queries, and which plugins are hogging resources. That can save you a lot of headaches in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Exactly. And I would say the most successful clients I’ve worked with are the ones who focus less on dashboards and numbers and more on working with the right people. Having a good relationship with a hosting company that offers solid support is often more important than staring at charts all day. When something goes wrong, it’s the support that matters most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, and that’s something we’ve noticed too. If the client has a skilled development team, then having good monitoring tools is great, because they can dig into the details themselves. But if you’re a store owner who doesn’t have that technical expertise, then having access to a knowledgeable and responsive support team is far more valuable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s like giving someone a spaceship—if they don’t know how to fly it, it’s useless. So having both—good tools and good support—covers all your bases. But if you had to choose between them, I’d recommend going with quality support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcel:<br />Exactly. The store owners I’ve worked with who have been the most successful aren’t necessarily worried about the fancy dashboards—they care about the people they work with. And having a reliable hosting partner with good support is more important than anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, everyone, that’s it for today. Thank you so much for listening and tuning in. This was, once again, Mike and I talking about WooCommerce and performance. We keep talking about performance—it’s important, I know! We’re probably getting a bit repetitive on that subject, but we have some future episodes ahead with different guests. We’re going to talk a lot more about development, too. So yeah, tune in for those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike, I’ll talk to you in the next one!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Sounds good, man. Thanks!</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>Woo DevChat</em></strong>, <strong>Marcel</strong> and <strong>Mike</strong> dive deep into the critical aspects of hosting for WooCommerce stores. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They explore how hosting directly impacts your store&#8217;s performance, sales, and user experience, and discuss essential factors like RAM, CPU power, PHP workers, caching systems, and database optimization. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation highlights the importance of choosing the right hosting provider that can scale with your store’s growth, while providing top-notch support. Whether you’re just starting out or building a high-traffic WooCommerce site, this episode will equip you with valuable insights to ensure your WooCommerce store runs smoothly and efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hosting Directly Impacts Performance and Sales</strong>: A slow-loading WooCommerce store can lead to lost sales and lower search engine rankings. Choosing a hosting provider with sufficient resources, speed, and reliability is crucial for success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Importance of Support</strong>: Quality support is just as essential as having the right hosting resources. A knowledgeable support team that can proactively troubleshoot and resolve issues can be a game-changer, especially for non-technical store owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RAM, CPU, and PHP Workers</strong>: WooCommerce sites require more RAM and CPU power than regular WordPress sites due to the dynamic nature of e-commerce. PHP workers are crucial for processing simultaneous tasks, and understanding the right balance of resources can prevent slowdowns during peak times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Caching Systems</strong>: Implementing effective caching strategies, such as page caching, object caching, and browser caching, is one of the most impactful ways to improve performance. However, WooCommerce stores require customized caching due to the dynamic content of e-commerce sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Database Optimization</strong>: Regularly optimizing your database by clearing transients and optimizing tables can significantly boost site performance, especially as your store grows and accumulates more data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scalability is Key</strong>: As your WooCommerce store grows, having a hosting provider that can easily scale from shared hosting to VPS or dedicated servers is important. Scaling smoothly without disruption requires the right provider and strong support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Backups and Security</strong>: Frequent backups and a robust security setup are non-negotiable for WooCommerce stores. Automated, smart backup systems and proactive monitoring can save you from major losses in the event of a failure or security breach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Monitoring and Staging Environments</strong>: Good hosting providers offer monitoring dashboards and the ability to create staging environments. These tools help developers test changes without affecting live sites and provide insights into performance, memory usage, and potential bottlenecks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wpvip.com/\">WordPressVIP</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://newrelic.com\"><strong>New Relic</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com\">Cloudflare</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://redis.io\">Redis</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.phpmyadmin.net\">phpMyAdmin</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com\">AWS (Amazon Web Services)</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com\">Google Cloud</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Sep 2024 08:55:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Matt: On WP Engine\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=126284\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://ma.tt/2024/09/on-wp-engine/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:182:\"<p>I wrote a bit more on Lee Wittlinger / Silver Lake and WP Engine over on WordPress.org: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/\">WP Engine is not WordPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 22 Sep 2024 00:12:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Engine is not WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17786\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4347:\"<p>It has to be said and repeated: <em>WP Engine is not WordPress</em>. My own mother was confused and thought <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/\">WP Engine</a> was an official thing. Their branding, marketing, advertising, and entire promise to customers is that they&#8217;re giving you WordPress, but they&#8217;re not. And they&#8217;re profiting off of the confusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnI-QcVSwMU\">I spoke yesterday at WordCamp</a> about how <a href=\"https://www.silverlake.com/people/lee-wittlinger/\">Lee Wittlinger</a> at <a href=\"https://www.silverlake.com/\">Silver Lake</a>, a private equity firm with $102B assets under management, can hollow out an open source community. (To summarize, they do about half a billion in revenue on top of WordPress and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/wp-engine/\">contribute back 40 hours a week</a>, Automattic is a similar size and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/automattic/\">contributes back 3,915 hours a week</a>.) Today, I would like to offer a specific, technical example of how they break the trust and sanctity of our software&#8217;s promise to users to save themselves money so they can extract more profits from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is a content management system, and the content is <em>sacred</em>. Every change you make to every page, every post, is tracked in a revision system, just like the Wikipedia. This means if you make a mistake, you can <em>always</em> undo it. It also means if you&#8217;re trying to figure out why something is on a page, you can see precisely the history and edits that led to it. These revisions are stored in our database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is very important, it&#8217;s at the core of the user promise of protecting your data, and it&#8217;s why WordPress is architected and designed to never lose anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WP Engine turns this off.</strong> They disable revisions because it costs them more money to store the history of the changes in the database, and they don&#8217;t want to spend that to protect your content. It strikes to the very heart of what WordPress does, and they shatter it, the integrity of your content. If you make a mistake, you have no way to get your content back, breaking the core promise of what WordPress does, which is manage and protect your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a screenshot of <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/support/platform-settings/#Post_Revisions\">their support page</a> saying they disable this across their 1.5 million WordPress installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-21-at-4.05.03 PM.png?resize=1024%2C864&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17787\" />\n\n\n\n<p>They say it&#8217;s slowing down your site, but what they mean is they want to avoid paying to store that data. We tested revisions on <em>all</em> of the recommended hosts on WordPress.org, and <em>none</em> disabled revisions by default. <strong>Why is WP Engine the only one that does?</strong> They are strip-mining the WordPress ecosystem, giving our users a crappier experience so they can make more money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What WP Engine gives you is not WordPress</strong>, it&#8217;s something that they&#8217;ve chopped up, hacked, butchered to look like WordPress, but actually they&#8217;re giving you a cheap knock-off and charging you more for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the many reasons they are a cancer to WordPress, and it’s important to remember that unchecked, cancer will spread.

Investors are amazing, they&#8217;re the fuel of entrepreneurship and capitalism and responsible for most of what we enjoy today. I can look in the eye of another founder and wholeheartedly recommend Automattic&#8217;s investors—True Ventures, Addition, Tiger Global, Salesforce, GIC, ICONIQ, LVMH/Aglaé, Akkadian, Wellington, Sweetwater, BlackRock, Alta Park, Schonfield, Chris Sacca&#8230;—and say they&#8217;ve upheld open source values and allowed us to nourish the open source ecosystem and flourish as a business. (They&#8217;re not an investor, but there are new folks like <a href=\"https://oss.capital/\">OSS Capital</a> which are totally open source aligned.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So investors, even &#8220;private equity&#8221; ones can be okay, but just like with anything, there are good ones and bad ones, so it is worthwhile to look into their track record. After an investor joins a company, what happens next? Do they change away from an <a href=\"https://opensource.org/\">Open Source</a> license? Does the community flourish or wither on the vine as a result of their actions? It can be complex because you can have, as we do in WordPress, some companies <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">contributing</a> and some companies just taking. Some investors, like ours, are minority investors, which means they don&#8217;t control the company. Some buy a majority share in companies and control them, and that&#8217;s where who ultimately owns things matters the most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can they change? Of course. Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future. I think everyone should be afforded that grace. But it can&#8217;t just be in words, it has to be in action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may make <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/session/an-in-person-qa-with-matt-mullenweg/\">my keynote tomorrow</a> a deep dive presentation into some specific examples of this going poorly, because I think it&#8217;s highly relevant to WordPress&#8217; survival.

Their Zero-Day Bug Bounty Program awarded the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/record-bounty-awarded-as-critical-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-patched-in-litespeed-cache-plugin\">highest bounty</a> in WordPress history &#8211; $14,400- to <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/database/researcher/185b44a7-75e2-4c31-848d-a534cb44e821\">John Blackbourn</a>, who exposed a critical vulnerability in the LiteSpeed Cache plugin last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I have been following Patchstack’s progress for some time, have had many great discussions with Oliver, and think that the team is on a noble and exciting mission to protect users of open-source technologies from cyber threats,” said Kristjan Laanemaa from Karma Ventures.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Sep 2024 04:33:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: Matt Mullenweg’s Ecosystem Thinking for Open Source Success \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=162209\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenwegs-ecosystem-thinking-for-open-source-success\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3986:\"<p>WordCamp US 2024 is in full swing, and Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of WordPress, shared his thoughts on a powerful philosophy driving Open Source.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ecosystem Thinking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg introduced the concept of &#8220;<a href=\"https://ma.tt/2024/09/ecosystem-thinking/\">Ecosystem Thinking</a>,&#8221;  a philosophy that drives successful collaborative projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<a href=\"https://opensource.org/\">Actual Open Source licenses</a> are the law that guarantees freedom, the bulwark against authoritarianism. But what makes Open Source work isn’t the law, it’s the ethos. It’s the social mores. It’s what I’m now calling Ecosystem Thinking: the mindset that separates any old software with an open source license from the software that’s alive, that’s humming with activity and contributions from a thousand places.” he noted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This philosophy comprises four essential elements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Learn</strong>: Embrace the beginner’s mindset and constantly engage with new ideas.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Evolve</strong>: Apply what you learn to the next iteration, allowing real-world feedback to guide you.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Teach</strong>: Teaching others reinforces your own understanding, spreading knowledge throughout the ecosystem.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nourish</strong>: Share the fruits of your success with the broader community to help everyone thrive.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Nourish’ is the philosophy behind WordPress’s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five For the Future</a> initiative, where companies and individuals commit a portion of their resources to supporting the WordPress project and ecosystem. This ethos is what keeps Open Source alive and vibrant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mislabeling Open Source</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>He also shared the challenges Open source is facing. Even though Open Source has taken over as an “intellectual and moral movement,&#8230; false prophets like Meta are trying to co-opt it.” He referenced Meta’s “open-source” AI model, Llama, as a prime example of this trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While LLaMA is free, its license restricts use for companies with over 700 million active users. Mullenweg argued that although Meta has the right to impose such terms, labeling it as &#8220;Open Source&#8221; misleads the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vote with your Wallet</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg encouraged the community to “<strong>vote with your wallet</strong>” by supporting companies that actively contribute to the Open Source ecosystem. He praised organizations like Newfold, Awesome Motive, 10up, Godaddy, Hostinger, and Google but warned of “parasitic entities that just want to feed off the host without giving anything back.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make his point, Mullenweg compared the Five For the Future contributions from Automattic and WP Engine, a competitor of similar size. Automattic contributes 3,786 hours per week, while WP Engine contributes just 47.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Those of us who are makers, who create the source, need to be wary of those who would take our creations and squeeze out the juice. They’re grifters who will hop onto the next fad, but we’re trying to build something big here, something long term—something that lasts for generations,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg urged the community to be mindful of their choices: “Think about that next time it comes up to renew your hosting or domain, weigh your dollars towards companies that give back more, because you’ll get back more, too. Freedom isn’t free.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the first time Mullenweg has discussed this point. “Those who care about the future of WordPress should spend their dollars with less parasitic companies,” <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-identifies-godaddy-as-a-parasitic-company-and-an-existential-threat-to-wordpress-future\">he said</a> in 2022. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 18:46:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"Do The Woo Community: A Blog for the Community, by the Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=85715\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://dothewoo.io/a-blog-for-the-community-by-the-community/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4824:\"Episode Transcript\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>BobWP:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, hello, BobWP here. I am sitting in my motel room recording this while at WordCamp US. So much stuff going on, this being the Thursday the 19th, have already done 2 days of the hectic schedule and now into the official two days of the camp</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot I could share with you so far, but that is not why I am here. And I mean by talking to you and not where I am physically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On September the 2nd I pushed out a post on Do the Woo called The Soft Relaunch of the Do the Woo Blog, It was short, and hinted a bit of what we have in store. Then while I&#8217;m here at WordCamp, I realized that in that post I said I would be telling you more about the blog. Which was not optimal nor did I plan that as it should have been.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I felt obligated to do this episode while knowing I still have a few things left to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let me share where we are at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned in that post, Ronald Gijsel and myself did a podcast while we brainstormed the ideas around what the Do the Wo blog would look like. Why was there no blog. At some point last year I decided to move posts off of the site and focus on the audio we were putting out. Several reasons for that but in hindsight it was probably a mistake or at least something I should have just let ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I realized, maybe I woke up, that the site had a big missing part to it. And also, I was missing blogging here at Do the Woo. For someone who has blogged since 2018, well, a void in my life. Of course, as Ronald and myself talked about the blog, it was obvious that we have the perfect site for a blog</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, a blog by the community and for the community. Want a rundown on my plans</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will blog of course. But hosts, guests and friends of do the woo will also guest post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are not going down the tutorial path, doing reviews, building a news blog or pitching products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we want is conversations continuing based on podcast episodes. For example, a guest wants to dive into a topic that they only were able to mention on the episode. Or perhaps they have additional thoughts that didn&#8217;t get covered. And yes, at anytime a past guest can come in and update us on something that was mentioned in their show. In other words, a lot of flexibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what about your the listener? Maybe leaving a comment isn&#8217;t enough for you. You may have thoughts on an episode and would like to write a guest post to share them with our audience. These could be as short as a paragraph or two, or if you have a lot to say, as long as you need to make it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, guest posts will be scrutinized to make sure they cover what we are looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a three things that will make your content that you post here so valuable. One we will be sharing soon, and the other two likely will be worked on for the next several month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, we will soon have things in place if you want to do a guest post, or maybe even become a regular. Things like guidelines, forms to submit your interest to us, etc, etc. In fact I will write a blog post something after I return home here from WordCamp US when all of these things are in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s it. If you did carve out sometime to actually listen to this and you are still at WordCampUS, please let&#8217;s connect and at least say hi if we haven&#8217;t already. And to everyone out there, we are excited to share and amplify even more voice from this community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the next time.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, <strong>BobWP</strong> records from his hotel room at WordCampUS, sharing exciting updates about the soft relaunch of the <em><strong>Do the Woo</strong></em> blog. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob reflects on past decisions, including the removal of blog posts from the site, and how he now realizes the blog’s absence created a void in the community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He outlines plans for the blog&#8217;s future, including contributions from hosts, guests, and even listeners, creating an open space for continued conversations around podcast episodes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your eyes and ears open to hear more about how <em>Do the Woo</em> is amplifying voices and building stronger community connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Links</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/blog/the-soft-relaunch-of-the-do-the-woo-blog/\"><strong>The Soft Relaunch of the Do the Woo Blog</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/unpacking-blogging-a-blogstorm-with-ronald-gijsel-and-bobwp/\">Unpacking Blogging, a BlogStorm with Ronald Gijsel and BobWP</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 19 Sep 2024 17:29:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WPTavern: WordPress.com Offers 1,000 Free Premium Websites to University Students\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=162113\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-offers-1000-free-premium-websites-to-students\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1636:\"<p>WordPress.com <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2024/09/17/free-websites-students/\">announced</a> that it is giving away 1,000 free premium websites exclusively to university students.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how YouTube can promote the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Jamie Marsland, and it says third appearance on the podcast, which is a first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie has recently embarked on an exciting new journey as the head of the WordPress YouTube channel at Automattic. This role is set to amplify the WordPress story through engaging and informative video content, capitalizing on YouTube&#8217;s reach to over 2.7 billion monthly users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you&#8217;ll hear, Jamie only started his role a few days prior to recording, but he&#8217;s already full of plan lists to transform the WordPress YouTube presence. Automattic created this role to ensure a more focused effort on growing the channel, which currently has around 36,000 subscribers, significantly lower than some of the other WordPress YouTube channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie envisions targeting distinct groups. Beginners, DIYers, developers and designers, agencies and freelancers, product suppliers, and the community. Each piece of content will aim to add value whilst trying to maintain some fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout our conversation, Jamie shares his insights into why this role is necessary, especially in light of commercial rivals like Wix and Squarespace, who possess enormous marketing budgets. He discusses the importance of bringing new users into the WordPress ecosystem, whether they&#8217;re complete beginners or migrating from other platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also explore Jamie&#8217;s broader vision for the channel, including making high quality content that genuinely adds value to the viewer, regardless of its production quality. He stresses that every video needs to answer the question of what value it brings to the audience. Fun and engagement are key themes, but quality content is paramount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also touch on his plans to bring in other voices, aiming to build a diverse team that reflects WordPress&#8217; global reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie also talks about the balance between engaging the YouTube algorithm and producing valuable content. He shares his experiences and strategies for creating content that draws listeners in, emphasizing the importance of creativity in ensuring all target groups find something of interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie assures us that his new role won&#8217;t mean an end to his own popular YouTube channel, which has been advocating for WordPress for many years. He plans to continue creating content on this channel, whilst focusing on growing the official WordPress channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, Jamie hints at the changes that might start materializing by October, post WordCamp US. He&#8217;s eager to hear from the community, so if you have innovative, fun or valuable content ideas, Jamie wants to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the evolving landscape of WordPress on YouTube, Jamie strategic approach, or how you might contribute to this exciting venture, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Jamie Marsland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast, again by Jamie Marsland. How you doing, Jamie?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:35] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I am really sorry about all these appearances. I&#8217;m great, thank you, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Honestly, the reason that you&#8217;re appearing many times is because you have many things to say. But I believe you&#8217;re the first person to appear for a third time. And it wasn&#8217;t all that long ago that we were talking about your speed builds happening at WordCamp Europe. Well, maybe that is going to come up today. Let&#8217;s find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:53] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Well, it&#8217;s coming to WordCamp US in a few weeks time, so there you go, there&#8217;s a plug for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, it&#8217;s exciting. Well, maybe we can get into that specifically a little bit later, but that&#8217;s not the main reason. The main reason is because you&#8217;ve taken on a brand new role. And rather than me butcher what that role is and what you&#8217;re doing, you just want to give us your brief potted bio?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I&#8217;m now working for Automattic as head of the wordpress.org YouTube channel, which is an incredibly exciting role to fulfill. So I started literally two days ago, and I&#8217;m now in day three, it&#8217;s Wednesday, isn&#8217;t it? Day three of my onboarding, of which I&#8217;m going to go onto the wordpress.org forums this afternoon as part of, when you join Automattic you do a support rotation, so I&#8217;ve got two weeks support rotation, and then I start in earnest on the YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is this a brand new role? My intuition says, I think it is because I&#8217;ve not heard of it before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:41] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> It is a brand new role. There is a team working diligently on the YouTube channel doing cool stuff, and they&#8217;ve grown it actually really well, but there&#8217;s no one sort of leading on the channel. Everyone in that team is doing lots of other cool stuff as well. So this is having somebody completely focused 100% on growing the channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so I&#8217;m imagining that more or less everybody knows what YouTube is, and probably has gone down that alley of stepping into YouTube, and then several hours later figuring out that they&#8217;ve lost their entire day on YouTube. Why do we need this role then? So you mentioned that there&#8217;s a team. Is it just that it was felt that that effort wasn&#8217;t sort of guided correctly, that there needs to be more content? Why the role?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:19] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Can I give you some stats on YouTube, because this blows my mind? So as of 2024, YouTube has more than 2.7 billion users every month. That&#8217;s 51% of all people who use the internet. One third of everyone in the world uses YouTube monthly, a third of everyone in the world uses YouTube monthly. And over half the people who use the internet on their phones visit YouTube each month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So YouTube is, I mean it&#8217;s just absolutely massive, and WordPress, the official channel, has as we speak, about 36,000 subscribers. And if you compare it to its, let&#8217;s say competitors, it&#8217;s lower than it needs to be. So that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s now a unrelenting focus from me on helping WordPress through that channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So is there a particular kind gap that you are trying to fill here? Because obviously, you know, YouTube is just full up of content for literally everything. Is it going to be directed mainly at a particular type of YouTube content? Do you have any sort of intuitions as how that&#8217;s going to go? You know, is it going to be related to Gutenberg, or Core? Well, I&#8217;ll leave it open to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:22] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> At the moment, and I&#8217;m obviously on day three, this is kind of how I view the world in terms of the content groups we&#8217;re going to aim content at. What I&#8217;m also asking everyone is to let me know what you think, so I&#8217;d be interested to know what you think about this, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So these are the kind of groups we&#8217;re going to target content at. So I&#8217;ve got beginners, group one. DIYers, developers. We&#8217;ve got designers, agencies and freelancers, product suppliers. So that&#8217;s plugins, and themes, and service providers, and then we&#8217;ve got the community. So broadly, six groups of target viewers that, at the moment, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking the type of content we&#8217;re going to produce content for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at the top of that, we have the kind of overlying everything is, you know, every piece of content that we want to produce on that channel needs to kind of tell the WordPress story, or help tell the WordPress story, what the story is. That&#8217;s all the things that make me love WordPress. So it&#8217;s empowering, it&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s open, it&#8217;s radical, it&#8217;s fun, it&#8217;s being used by loads and loads of people. So everything needs to kind of fit under that story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we&#8217;ve got those groups of people that we want to target content at. And then within that we&#8217;re going to have a number of different formats. And then flowing from those formats will be the actual content itself. That&#8217;s the way I&#8217;m viewing the world at the moment. Early days, I&#8217;m asking people to give me their feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m going to give you a little bit of feedback on that. So you had six categories there, and they all speak to people already using WordPress. I wonder if part of the role, given all of the talk that we&#8217;ve had recently about, you know, commercial rivals in the website building space having giant marketing budgets, is that piece of advertising to the, as yet undecided, website builder. Drawing in people who are just curious about starting a career in web development, or want their own website? And obviously WordPress has that sort of free and open credentialing to it. Trying to draw them in as well and just say, okay, here&#8217;s WordPress, you&#8217;ve never used it, this is what it could do for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:12] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, and that&#8217;s a massive part of my thinking. I would probably group that group of people into beginners or pre beginners. Yeah, that was one of the biggest pieces of feedback. I put out this tweet, and put a post on Facebook and LinkedIn, and got tons of feedback and fantastic ideas from people of the type of content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was one of the strong themes coming through is, how do we bring people on board to WordPress from either, they&#8217;re looking for the first time, or they&#8217;re using something like Wix and they don&#8217;t realise where the roadblocks they&#8217;re going to hit at some point in the future? So, one hundred percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just a little bit of personal story then. How did this role come your way then? So just curious as to, two sides to that really. How did the negotiations happen and, you know, how did you get into this role existing in the first place, and why the role now? I guess I&#8217;m alluding to the whole Wix thing that I mentioned a moment ago. Is it that the time is right to concern ourselves with the commercial rivals out there and the march that they&#8217;ve got into the marketplace?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:05] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> So I&#8217;m going to skip some steps here, just to give you a broad brush stroke. So I did some research about, I guess it was a year and a half ago was it, maybe two years ago, looking at the YouTube channels of wordpress.com, wordpress.org, and also the competitors, so Wix, Squarespace, Shopify, and a few others. Did a blog post, and then I sent the blog post around to some people within Automattic that I&#8217;d sort of been chatting to, and saying, I can help with some of this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m skipping a lot of steps here, Nathan. And following from that, I had lots of discussions. And then I did a series of videos with wordpress.com and the team at wordpress.com, and started chatting to some people within Automattic. So I did 24 videos for them. Obviously more conversations around the video strategy for .com and .org. And, again, I&#8217;m skipping lots of steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I met up with Matt Mullenweg in Turin for an hour, and had a fantastic chat around video, and content, and competitors, and then more conversations. And then it kind of crystallised while I was on a mountain, climbing up a mountain, when I say climbing a mountain, I was walking along a mountain in France. You know, started to formulate what the role could be, what the need was, you know, my desire to do it, which was massive. So for me it&#8217;s like the perfect, because I&#8217;ve been kind of doing this stuff on my own channel for three years. So this was like the perfect opportunity to kind of work on a bigger stage really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m curious as to the nature of the conversation that you had with Matt. Obviously, Matt, the co-founder of WordPress, largely guides the project, if you like. We have a lot of intuitions that come from Matt, which then turn into the reality of the project. Whilst I don&#8217;t want you to reveal anything of a confidential nature, I am curious as to hear what thoughts came up in that meeting as to the importance of this job, you know, the kinds of things that he would like to have seen you doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:47] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I mean the first thing to say, it was a great conversation because I&#8217;d never met Matt before. So, we struck it off really well, which was fantastic, and massively intellectually curious, that was a very interesting conversation. But it was kind of centered around content, and the importance of video content, and what WordPress is doing in terms of video content at the moment, and just the massive opportunity there is for video content in the WordPress, official WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, there&#8217;s some amazing content being produced by other creators, but on the official channel, as I say, we&#8217;ve got 36,000 subscribers. So there&#8217;s a massive opportunity to get more engagement, and sort of spread the WordPress word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The fact that you are doing content on YouTube, does it allow you this role to also do video content elsewhere? So one of the things that comes into mind is the Learn project, so learn.wordpress.org is making lots of educational content, much of it in the form of videos. I wondered if there was any overlap with those teams, or any opportunity to overlap. Because it sounds like a lot of the pieces that you&#8217;re going to be making are educational in nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:48] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Obviously it&#8217;s very early days, and they&#8217;ve got a team producing lots of Learn content, which is currently going on the YouTube channel, which is great. There&#8217;s an interesting space which says, what is the connection? Because some of the content they&#8217;re doing is very, very good if you are going step by step through videos. But I think there&#8217;s an interesting discussion that says, how can we start to tailor some of that content? So it&#8217;s kind of more suited to specific YouTube audiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because when you go onto YouTube, you&#8217;re kind of in a different frame of mind than if you are going onto a learning management system. And I think they&#8217;re two quite separate pieces of content, like some of the content I produce on my channel is more edutainment than just educating people around it. It&#8217;s got to kind of grab them quite quickly, and you&#8217;ll get more engagement and more learning. So there&#8217;s some interesting, definitely some interesting overlaps there. Early thinking on that though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> One of the things that Matt said during his address in WordCamp Europe, where obviously you had your meeting with him, one of the things that I took away from that was that he wants WordPress to feel a bit more fun. I don&#8217;t really have my finger on the pulse of what entirely he made of that, but it did strike me that your speed builds was a really, you know, it was a really credible way of doing that. It&#8217;s entertainment with learning bolted in, which is really nice. You get the fun of doing it at the same time, and if you&#8217;re paying attention, you will actually learn things, which is kind of like the perfect goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did wonder that was how you were hoping to drive it, if it was supposed to be fun. If you&#8217;d got any guidelines about that, if you&#8217;ve got any thoughts on that. Because I always enjoy watching fun content more than sort of the dry stuff. But nevertheless, sometimes the dry stuff is what you need to do, so whether it&#8217;s a bit of everything, or direction is fun, over to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:26] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> We&#8217;ll bring the fun. There will be more fun, but it&#8217;s not all going to be fun. But it all needs to be great. I think the key thing is it&#8217;s going to have massive value. If it&#8217;s going on the channel, it needs to have massive value to whoever&#8217;s watching it, and that&#8217;s probably somebody within those six groups. So there will definitely be some, I&#8217;ve got some ideas, there&#8217;ll definitely be some fun stuff, and definitely more live stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to try and have a connection with the end users that are using WordPress. So definitely more fun. But there&#8217;s some really cool stuff going on on the wordpress.org channel, which, with a little bit of love and attention, we can elevate to the next level quite easily. Like there&#8217;s some amazing developer stuff going on with Justin Tadlock and his team, and Nick Diego, and Ryan Welcher. Just gold dust in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s some really simple things we can do really quickly to get them more views. So there&#8217;s some easy low hanging fruit. So some of that developer stuff is absolutely fantastic, but there is a lot of stuff on there that&#8217;s, at the moment there&#8217;s this automatic feed, so there&#8217;s a lot of stuff that just, it&#8217;s like a bucket, just gets dumped on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s a conversation to be had around how we tailor that stuff. Do we keep that process going where it&#8217;s just automated? So we have lots and lots of videos on there, which don&#8217;t necessarily all reflect what we&#8217;re trying to reflect in terms of the WordPress story. I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s answered your question, but there&#8217;s going to be more fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Running through that, the message that you gave me at the beginning of that little section was that you want it to be of high quality. The importance is on the high quality. So if it&#8217;s fun and high quality, that&#8217;s great, if it&#8217;s serious and high quality, it&#8217;s great. But if it&#8217;s fun and low quality, no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:50] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> And I think, when I say high quality, I&#8217;m not talking about production value, I&#8217;m talking about value to the person watching it. If it&#8217;s filmed on a phone in a field and it&#8217;s absolute gold dust, then that&#8217;s okay. But it has to be, every bit of content has to ask itself the question, what value am I giving to the person watching this? Why are they going to watch this piece of content? And if we can&#8217;t answer that, then it shouldn&#8217;t be on the channel anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting, sort of editorial guidelines, you know, if the BBC, for example, the British Broadcasting Corporation, I imagine they have a quality guideline about how it looks and feels, not just about the quality of the content. But that&#8217;s an interesting position that you take there. If the content is good but the production quality is not that great, that gets a pass.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:26] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I think there&#8217;s probably a couple of phases of this. The first phase is, it&#8217;s got to be all about the content. And then the second phase, then we look at the production. And you can do these together, but the most important thing is the content has got to have, it&#8217;s got to have value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best lessons I ever learned in running a YouTube channel is that there&#8217;s only three reasons why somebody will ever click on a YouTube thumbnail, because you are competing against lots of other people on YouTube. And those are curiosity, number one, hope, number two, or fear. Those are the three psychological triggers that make anyone click onto a YouTube video. There&#8217;s some broad guidelines we can start to introduce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think also it&#8217;s important for the creator of the video to have a white border around them, and to be pointing at something with their mouth open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:08] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Actually, no, that&#8217;s not true anymore. There&#8217;s been some stats that show that mouth open isn&#8217;t working anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. Oh gosh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:13] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I&#8217;m serious about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> People go into it at that level. So the content that you&#8217;ve created on your own YouTube channel has been you creating content, and you&#8217;ve obviously been very successful at that, and I imagine that that is the primary reason that you&#8217;ve got into this discussion, got this job. So bravo for that firstly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But secondly, does this new job point to an era in which you, the head of YouTube, are making all of the content, or are you hoping to bring other voices in? And into that question I&#8217;m going to throw the sort of international thing as well, you know, different languages, different parts of the world, different perspectives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:47] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> So, no, definitely won&#8217;t just be me producing videos. I mean, my plan is to make myself redundant over the next three or four years, and build a team of younger, diverse people that reflect where WordPress is heading. So that&#8217;s part of my plan. And then part of my plan is, and I&#8217;ve been reaching out to other content creators in the WordPress space, is to help them to amplify themselves, and get them on the channel as well. Because there&#8217;s some people doing some amazing stuff. And also people in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus we&#8217;ve already got some existing amazing content that&#8217;s going on through people like Justin and his team, and the Learn team. So absolutely not, it won&#8217;t just be me. I will definitely be on the channel, but hopefully I&#8217;ll be a fraction of the overall content going forward. There was another part of your question, which I didn&#8217;t answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, there was the international part, so the different languages all around the world. So it&#8217;s not just in English basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:30] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a really interesting one. So one of the challenges you face when you run a YouTube channel is that, if you produce a piece of content that doesn&#8217;t get many views, it&#8217;s a bit of a channel killer. So what will happen is their algorithm will say, they&#8217;ve just produced, you might have one piece of content that gets like 10,000 views, if you produce a piece of content that only gets like 12 views, that will affect the overall channel views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to be aware of that when you&#8217;re running and trying to grow YouTube channel. I&#8217;m going to go onto the international bit. So that&#8217;s one of the things we need to confront pretty quickly. We need to make sure that the content we&#8217;re producing is always creating a high number of views, otherwise it affects the overall health of the channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one of the decisions on the international stuff is, does that fit into that? How does that fit into that? Does that affect the channel because our audience is expecting one thing and they get another thing, and it might get lower views? Or do we say, we create multiple channels for multiple languages, or do we create multiple channels for multiple, like there&#8217;s thousands of word, well, not thousands, but there&#8217;s lots and lots of WordCamps that happen around the world which are currently being presented on the YouTube channel, which might not get massive amount of views, but are very important content. So the question is, do we have a separate channel for those, so it doesn&#8217;t affect the main channel in terms of the algorithm and kind of story we&#8217;re trying to tell on those? So those are some of the kind of quite difficult decisions we need to make fairly early on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s curious because you are having to worry about the algorithm of YouTube, not just the quality of the content, but whether the content is going to receive the click. So some part of your brain has to be engaged with how viral, for want of a better word, maybe that&#8217;s not quite right word. But, you know, something like, how viral will this piece of content be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I guess that raises concerns about, if we&#8217;re always chasing the algorithm, do we then drop the stuff which may not get the clicks or the views, but could be really important? So for example, the last piece you mentioned, I think it was number six, community, that may not get quite the number of views as, oh I don&#8217;t know, the latest, greatest new feature that&#8217;s come out in WordPress, or your speed builds, or whatever that may be. But it&#8217;s still equally important, and that&#8217;s going to be a difficult tightrope to tread, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s sprinkling that stuff in that you have an intuition won&#8217;t be quite so popular, but is probably needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:31] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> But I think there&#8217;s creative ways of making that stuff interesting to people that it will get clicks. That&#8217;s the challenge of the channel, right? So all those six groups, I&#8217;m confident we could create content that is really interesting, that would get a large amount of clicks. But it needs to speak, it needs to focus on the value it&#8217;s bringing to the people that are watching it. That&#8217;s got to be the a hundred percent focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spend a huge amount of time on my thumbnails and title, and I want to instill that in the content that&#8217;s going on the channel. I do that because, and this isn&#8217;t just me making this stuff up, this is coming from like, the best YouTubers all do this as well. And if you do that, then it focuses your video on the value you are creating. You are trying to create to the person watching it. And if you can&#8217;t get a YouTube thumbnail and title sorted out, it means you haven&#8217;t got your story straight in your head, and you&#8217;re not sure on the value of this piece of content is going to bring to the people watching it. If you can&#8217;t do that, then you shouldn&#8217;t make the video. It&#8217;s a really useful discipline to go through, and it&#8217;s one I want to instill on any piece of content going forward, because it focuses the whole point of the video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But the bottom line is you are open to other voices, it&#8217;s not just going to be Jamie making video content. And a question which is related to that, but not entirely the same, the content that I&#8217;ve seen of you so far has been heavily related to a core version of WordPress. You know, you download WordPress from .org and you run with that. You&#8217;re not chucking a load of other things in, third party plugins, and themes, and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I do wonder if that has a place in this new future. Whether or not third party plugins, themes, blocks, whatever it may be, whether there&#8217;s going to be scope for those. Maybe there&#8217;ll be an embargo on, well, it has to be in the repository. I don&#8217;t know. Again, just over to you, what are your thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:04] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, my view is a hundred percent, I want those in there. Because it&#8217;s one of the best things about WordPress, that we have 60,000 plugins and thousands of amazing themes. The challenge is how you do that without annoying the heck out of everybody that isn&#8217;t featured on that week. I want to find formats that we can showcase stuff without annoying people that aren&#8217;t on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you think about it, wordpress.org is already advertising all those 60,000 plugins, so we absolutely should be. And there&#8217;s some amazing stuff happening, some amazing innovation happening, so we definitely want to showcase that stuff on the official channel, is my view at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m just curious about the cadence at which you are hoping to do this. Because at the moment, Jamie&#8217;s YouTube channel, I presume that there is importance in you getting content out on a regular basis to satisfy the algorithm. But it&#8217;s up you how often you want to do that. You know, you can take a week off here, a week off there, and go out for a walk or whatever, whenever you feel. And I&#8217;m just wondering how this is going to play. Do you have intuitions there? You know, it&#8217;s got to be several things a week, several things a day. It&#8217;s a big community after all, we could probably create that content. But, any thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:03] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Well, yeah, if you look, at the moment there&#8217;s tons of content going on it, but I think there&#8217;s too much content. I think the cadence will be, the first step is to get a content plan, which I&#8217;m going to share I think at this point, get a content plan together drawing on all those things that I&#8217;ve talked you through already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I think the cadence drops out from that. Once you&#8217;ve got the content structure in terms of those groups, and then you&#8217;ve got the formats flowing from those. So like we&#8217;ve already got developer hours who have a certain cadence. And then you&#8217;ve got the content plan from that, the cadence will be dropping out from that. But my view is at least two a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But probably, as we start to power the engine many more. And, you know, the other thing that we want to do far more of is repurposing this content for like social media, because at the moment that&#8217;s not really happening. Once we get the source content the way we want it, that&#8217;ll be much, much easier. Because that&#8217;s been a lot of the growth of my channel, is resharing relentlessly on Twitter, and Facebook, and LinkedIn. LinkedIn especially at moment, actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;ve obviously been making content recently, and I presume you&#8217;re doing that because you enjoy it. Is there any part of you which is a little bit nervous about the fact that you are going to have this more managerial role and, you know, taking care of other people&#8217;s content, and less time in the video editor, making the content, thinking about the topics, and creating the titles and the thumbnails and all that? They&#8217;ll presumably be handled by you, but also by other people. Is there a bit of you, which is, I don&#8217;t know, a little bit sad at waving goodbye to your own endeavors?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:20] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I&#8217;m not waving goodbye to them. So my own channel is going to carry on. And actually this will probably give me, well, it will give me more freedom to be a bit more, I&#8217;m going to be quite experimental, but probably more experimental on my own channel. So that&#8217;s definitely going to continue. I&#8217;ve paused sponsorships at the moment on that channel, just to avoid some conflicts of interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I have to say, I did have pre-match nerves about two weeks ago when I first got the job. Because normally I wake up and I&#8217;ve got like a hundred ideas banging around my head for videos, and for about a week I literally had nothing going on in there. It was like a vacuum of ideas, which was a bit worrying. Thankfully they&#8217;re back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, I&#8217;m so excited about being able to run a channel, and there&#8217;s all these amazing people that I can now, that I&#8217;m already chatting to about the stuff they&#8217;re already doing and how we can take it to the next level. So the community aspects are like incredibly exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So just to be clear, there&#8217;s no embargo on Jamie ceasing doing what Jamie&#8217;s doing already. You&#8217;ve got free reign to keep making your own content. You know, you&#8217;re a good custodian of that. You don&#8217;t create incendiary content and drop a bomb walk away, or at least that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;ve seen anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:20] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I&#8217;ve been advocating for this, for WordPress, for three years on my own channel. So it&#8217;d be a bit weird if I stopped. I&#8217;ve got over 100,000 subscribers on that channel now, so it&#8217;d be a bit weird if I didn&#8217;t keep producing video content that kind of advertise WordPress on that channel because it&#8217;s got a big audience. The same with my Twitter and LinkedIn. I&#8217;ll use all those channels to help the wordpress.org channel as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you know if that puts you in a unique position at Automattic? Because I don&#8217;t know, I genuinely don&#8217;t know the answer to this, but I have some thoughts that when people join Automattic, there may be contractual things that they can and cannot do. And obviously in this case, you know, that probably doesn&#8217;t matter quite so much because it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re doing two jobs. Your YouTube channel is presumably going to be in your evenings and weekends. It returns to being more of a hobby. There&#8217;s just a thought around that, whether people have, you know, mentioned that to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:06] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> They have mentioned that to me. And it is a unique position, I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s any perfect scenario for it because if I hadn&#8217;t grown the channel, then I probably wouldn&#8217;t be good for the YouTube job, because I&#8217;ve got experience of running a YouTube channel. So it would be quite hard to run this. And then people would say, well, why are you running the YouTube channel if you&#8217;ve never run a YouTube channel before? That&#8217;s kind of a difficult one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also it is unique because, if you think about it, Automatticians obviously tweet and make videos on their own channels, you wouldn&#8217;t expect them not to do that because they&#8217;re tweeting. To answer you, it is a unique thing. I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s any easy answer to it, apart from I&#8217;m hopefully helping WordPress in everything I&#8217;m doing. That&#8217;s been the sole point of my own channels, is to advocate strongly for WordPress over the last three years. So I&#8217;ve kind of been doing this job for free until recently, when I started taking sponsorships for a while. It feels like a continuation that, but just on the official channel actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When do you anticipate we&#8217;re going to see the beginnings of your endeavors here? So we&#8217;re recording this very early in September, 2024. You&#8217;re obviously doing the support role at Automattic, answering support tickets, just like every other Automattician did. And once that fortnight, two weeks is expired, presumably you&#8217;ll have your head turned onto this role. How long do you think we need to wait before we start seeing the ball rolling?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:23] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I&#8217;ve got two weeks rotation, and then we&#8217;ve got WordCamp US, which is very exciting. Come and check out the speed build on the 19th with Brian Coords and Amber Hinds, which is going to be an exciting one. I think we&#8217;re in the main room as well, so that could be huge if we are, that could be a big one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I suspect we&#8217;ll start seeing some changes around October. It&#8217;s important to do some groundwork first before just breaking everything. Although we could just break everything, and see how it goes. See how many people I can annoy within a shortest space of time. But I&#8217;m very impatient to get on and start improving things. But also incredibly excited because there&#8217;s so much cool stuff happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if anyone&#8217;s got, you know, I&#8217;ve been asking people, if you&#8217;ve got anything exciting going on that you want to share with the world around WordPress, whether it&#8217;s innovative, fun, crazy, enterprise, beginner. I really want to hear your stories, so just send them to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When you say send them to you, what&#8217;s the best way to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:12] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Good question. So I&#8217;ve got an Automattic email, now this is very strange. Still don&#8217;t know what it is, I think it&#8217;s jamie.marsland@automattic.com, or just tweet me on Twitter at pootlepress. But yeah, just get in touch. Send me your ideas, I want as many ideas as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And if you&#8217;re listening to this in the year 2025, I presume you&#8217;re going to be heading to youtube.com/wordpress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:32] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yes, exactly. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m not entirely sure whether that&#8217;s the right URL, but I&#8217;ll make sure to find out, and link it into the show notes. So hopefully this episode will reach the airwaves prior to WordCamp US. And you are doing a speed build, and as you said, it&#8217;s Brian Coords. If you&#8217;re not familiar with Brian, I think it&#8217;s fair to classify him as developer. And you&#8217;ve also got Amber Hinds, and I think it&#8217;s fair to classify Amber as accessibility advocate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought that was a really curious combination. And I wondered if that was very intentional in terms of two different outputs. If you&#8217;re following Brian, I&#8217;m presuming we&#8217;re going to see a focused on the front end, focused on the design, making it look accurate to whatever it is that you serve up. Whereas I was curious, you know, are we going to see Amber focusing on just getting the menu exactly right? Which may take the full half an hour with all the aria labels and things. Are you hoping for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:22] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I am hoping for that. I think it could be really interesting. But in the heat of panic, who knows what might happen. I think Brian&#8217;s been practicing as well. He&#8217;s done a live practice on YouTube, which I think shocked Amber a little bit. But yeah, I think it&#8217;ll be a really interesting combination to see the two different approaches. And I still haven&#8217;t chosen the website, so if anyone&#8217;s got any ideas for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s Ling&#8217;s Cars, let&#8217;s be honest. It&#8217;s not going to be Ling&#8217;s Cars. Okay, well, that genuinely is everything that I&#8217;ve got to ask you today. So, Jamie Marsland, all the best. First of all, massive congratulations. Your endeavors have not gone unrecognised by just about everybody in the community. The quality of what you&#8217;ve been doing has been second to none, and utterly deserved position. And I hope it proves to be everything that you wish it to be. Well done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:03] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Thank you so much, Nathan. Good to talk.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Jamie Marsland, and it’s his third appearance on the podcast, which is a first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie has recently embarked on an exciting new journey as the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jamie-marsland-joins-automattic-as-head-of-wordpress-youtube\">Head of the WordPress YouTube channel at Automattic</a>. This role is set to amplify the WordPress story through engaging and informative video content, capitalising on YouTube&#8217;s reach to over 2.7 billion monthly users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you’ll hear, Jamie only started his role a few days prior to recording, but he’s already full of plans to transform the WordPress YouTube presence. Automattic created this role to ensure a more focused effort on growing the channel, which currently has around 36,000 subscribers, significantly lower than some of the other WordPress YouTube channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie envisions targeting distinct groups: beginners, DIYers, developers and designers, agencies and freelancers, product suppliers, and the community. Each piece of content will aim to add value, whilst trying to maintain some fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout our conversation, Jamie shares his insights into why this role is necessary, especially in light of commercial rivals like Wix and Squarespace, who possess enormous marketing budgets. He discusses the importance of bringing new users into the WordPress ecosystem, whether they&#8217;re complete beginners or migrating from other platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also explore Jamie&#8217;s broader vision for the channel, including making high-quality content that genuinely adds value to the viewer, regardless of its production quality. He stresses that every video needs to answer the question of what value it brings to the audience. Fun and engagement are key themes, but quality content is paramount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also touch on his plans to bring in other voices, aiming to build a diverse team that reflects WordPress&#8217; global reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie also talks about the balance between engaging the YouTube algorithm and producing valuable content. He shares his experiences and strategies for creating content that draw viewers in, emphasising the importance of creativity in ensuring all target groups find something of interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie assures us that his new role won&#8217;t mean an end to his own popular YouTube channel, which has been advocating for WordPress for many years. He plans to continue creating content on this channel, whilst focusing on growing the official WordPress channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, Jamie hints at the changes that might start materialising by October, post WordCamp US. He&#8217;s eager to hear from the community, so if you have innovative, fun, or valuable content ideas, Jamie wants to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the evolving landscape of WordPress on YouTube, Jamie&#8217;s strategic approach, or how you might contribute to this exciting venture, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/session/speed-build-competition/\">Jamie&#8217;s Speed Build session at WordCamp US 2024</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/wordpress\">WordPress YouTube channel</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/\">Developer Blog</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/pootlepress\">Jamie on X</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 Sep 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"Matt: WordCamp US &amp; Ecosystem Thinking\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=125868\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://ma.tt/2024/09/ecosystem-thinking/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7820:\"<p>(This post should be read while listening to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vTD8rnrlYk\">Wish by Joshua Redman</a>. The writing is  synchronized to the music reading speed.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributor day just wrapped up for <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2024/\">Portland for WordCamp US</a>. If you ever have a chance to visit a WordCamp, I recommend it. It&#8217;s an amazing group of people brought together by this crazy idea that by working together regardless of our differences or where we came from or what school we went to we can be united by a simple yet groundbreaking idea: that software can give you more Freedom. Freedom to <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/hp.html\">hack</a>, freedom to charge, freedom to break it, freedom to do things I disagree with, freedom to experiment, freedom to be yourself, freedom expressed across the entire range of the human condition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open Source, once <a href=\"http://www.catb.org/~esr/halloween/\">ridiculed and attacked by the professional classes</a>, has taken over as an intellectual and moral movement. Its followers are legion within every major tech company. Yet, even now, false prophets like Meta are trying to co-opt it. Llama, its <a href=\"https://www.llama.com/\">“open source” AI model</a>, is free to use—at least until &#8220;<em>monthly active users of the products or services made available by or for Licensee, or Licensee’s affiliates, is greater than 700 million monthly active users in the preceding calendar month</em>.&#8221; <a href=\"https://ai.meta.com/llama/license/\">Seriously</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excuse me? Is that registered users? Visitors to WordPress-powered sites? (Which number in the billions.) That&#8217;s like if the US Government said you had freedom of speech until you made over 50 grand in the preceding calendar year, at which point your First Amendment rights were revoked. No! That&#8217;s not Open Source. That&#8217;s not freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe Meta should have the right to set their terms—they&#8217;re smart business, and an amazing deal for users of Llama—but don&#8217;t pretend Llama is Open Source when it doesn&#8217;t actually increase humanity&#8217;s freedom. It&#8217;s a proprietary license, issued at Meta’s discretion and whim. If you use it, you’re effectively a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassal_state\">vassal state</a> of Meta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When corporations disingenuously claim to be &#8220;open source&#8221; for marketing purposes, it&#8217;s a clear sign that Open Source is winning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://opensource.org/\">Actual Open Source licenses</a> are the law that guarantees freedom, the bulwark against authoritarianism. But what makes Open Source work isn&#8217;t the law, it&#8217;s the ethos. It’s the social mores. It’s what I&#8217;m now calling <strong>Ecosystem Thinking</strong>: the mindset that separates any old software with an open source license from the software that&#8217;s <em>alive</em>, that’s humming with activity and contributions from a thousand places.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"604\" height=\"308\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2024/09/Ecosystem-Thinking-1024x523.png?resize=604%2C308&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-125892\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Ecosystem Thinking has four parts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Learn</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Evolve</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Teach</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nourish</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn</strong> is about keeping ourselves in a <a href=\"https://zenhabits.net/beginner/\">beginner&#8217;s mind</a>, the curiosity to always engage with new ideas and approaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Evolve</strong> is where we apply those learnings to our next iteration, our next version. We see how things work in the real world: it’s the natural selection of actual usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Teach</strong> is actually where we learn even more, because you don&#8217;t really know something until you teach it. We open source our knowledge by sharing what we&#8217;ve learned, so others can follow on the same path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nourish</strong> is the trickiest, and most important part: it&#8217;s where we water the garden. If you&#8217;ve done the previous three steps, you&#8217;ve been very successful; now your responsibility is to spread the fruits of your labors around the ecosystem so that everyone can succeed together. This is the philosophy behind <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five For the Future</a>, which you&#8217;re going to see us emphasize a lot more now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the ecosystem. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang\">But if it’s the yin, what&#8217;s the yang</a>? This openness and generosity will attract parasitic entities that just want to feed off the host without giving anything back. There are companies that participate in the Learn/Evolve/Teach/Nourish loop like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FernGully:_The_Last_Rainforest\">FernGully rainforest</a>, and there are those who treat Open Source simply as a resource to extract from its natural surroundings, like oil from the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compare the Five For the Future pages from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/automattic/\">Automattic</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/wp-engine/\">WP Engine</a>, two companies that are roughly the same size with revenue in the ballpark of half a billion. These pledges are just a proxy and aren&#8217;t perfectly accurate, but as I write this, Automattic has 3,786 hours per week (not even counting me!), and WP Engine has 47 hours. WP Engine has good people, some of whom are listed on that page, but the company is controlled by <a href=\"https://www.silverlake.com/\">Silver Lake</a>, a private equity firm with $102 billion in assets under management. Silver Lake doesn&#8217;t give a dang about your Open Source ideals. It just wants a return on capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s at this point that I ask everyone in the WordPress community to <strong>vote with your wallet</strong>. Who are you giving your money to? Someone who&#8217;s going to nourish the ecosystem, or someone who’s going to frack every bit of value out of it until it withers? <a href=\"https://newfold.com/\">Newfold</a>, especially since its acquisition of Yoast and Yith, gives back. (I&#8217;ve asked them to consolidate their Five for the Future pages to better represent the breadth of their contributions.) So does <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/awesome-motive/\">Awesome Motive</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/10up/\">10up</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/godaddy/\">Godaddy</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/hostinger-international/\">Hostinger</a>, even <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/pledge/google/\">Google</a>. Think about that next time it comes up to renew your hosting or domain, weigh your dollars towards companies that give back more, because you&#8217;ll get back more, too. Freedom isn&#8217;t free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those of us who are makers, who create the source, need to be wary of those who would take our creations and squeeze out the juice.

They also presented the pilot dashboards developed for the Make/WordPress Core, Community, and Training teams, along with key statistics from the WordPress 6.6 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">History and Challenges</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of performance dashboards dates back to 2021 when Community Gardener <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2021/02/26/would-stats-dashboards-help-your-team/\">Ian Dunn started a discussion </a>about “the idea of having a stats dashboard for each Make team. If that’d make a big impact, Meta could build an automated system to facilitate it.”&nbsp; This sparked interest, particularly from the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/03/04/request-for-feedback-community-team-stats-dashboard/\">Community</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/2023/04/request-for-input-support-stats/\">Support</a> teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The topic resurfaced at WordCamp Europe 2023, where Matt Mullenweg highlighted the importance of &#8220;project health dashboards&#8221; that provide better visibility into the performance of various teams. This led to the formation of a working group composed of Naoko Takano, Isotta Peira, Hari Shanker, and Courtney Robertson, tasked with turning this idea into reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team sought community input through<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/sustainability/2024/06/07/may-project-health-hangouts-summary/\"> project health hangouts</a> this year and analyzed the data using the open-source tool Bitergia Analytics. However, Bitergia lacked integration with several essential tools frequently used by WordPress teams, such as HelpScout, Figma, Trac, SVN, and GlotPress. To fill this gap, the working group manually analyzed additional data sources, including the WordPress 6.6 props list and internal contributor data from the Community and Training teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hari Shanker acknowledged the challenges in manual data compilation, stating, “Manually compiling the data is time-consuming and may not be sustainable. @courane01 and I invested significant effort into preparing them. If they prove valuable, we hope to encourage other Make/Teams to create their own and explore a project-wide dashboard, though this could be resource-intensive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Insights From the Dashboards</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/core-team-dashboard/\"><strong>Core Team dashboard</strong></a> reveals that 37% of WordPress 6.6 contributors were new, highlighting the project&#8217;s ability to attract fresh talent. However, there’s a growing concern as the number of inactive contributors in 2024 is rising, and close/merge rates in Core GitHub repositories are declining. Contributions tend to spike around major releases, and much of the work is driven by sponsored contributors from companies like Automattic, Yoast, GoDaddy, and 10up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/training-team-dashboard/\"><strong>Training Team</strong></a> has exceeded its goals, achieving a 50% retention rate for video content and an enrollment rate of almost 60% for its courses. The Learning Pathways project also performed well, with high enrollment and course completion rates, along with an impressive 90% learner satisfaction rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/community-team-dashboard/\"><strong>Community Team</strong></a> is just shy of its 45% target for new attendee participation, with a current rate of 44.76%. While the number of WordPress events dipped after the pandemic, the team has seen steady improvement in event participation as in-person gatherings continue to recover.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Insights From WordPress 6.6 Stats</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Major points include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Approximately 640 people from 53 countries and 129 companies contributed to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/wordpress-6-6-statistics/\">WordPress 6.6</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>241 people contributed to WordPress Core for the first time, making up about 38% of the total contributors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The USA led with 1033 contributions, followed by Australia with 762 contributions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In terms of contributors by country, the USA had 84, followed by India with 69, and Bangladesh with 23.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Automattic had the largest number of contributors (105 people), followed by rtCamp (14), and 10up (12).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>26.5% of all WordPress 6.6 contributors were officially pledged through Five for the Future, accounting for 75.5% of all props.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Next Steps&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our long-term goal is to build automated, live dashboards for WordPress,” Hari Shanker revealed. The dashboards are in the experimental phase and future developments will depend on community feedback.

So the temperatures—last time we spoke, the temperatures were really chilly in Sydney, but now they&#8217;ve come all the way back up. So high twenties, almost 30 degrees, which is nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Wow. Yeah. Well, that sounds like Indonesia, but I feel like it&#8217;s been really, really hot in the last few days. So what&#8217;s chilly by your standard for Sydney?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Probably 10 to 12 degrees during the day. That’d be cold, and close to zero at night, but that&#8217;s nothing compared to where I&#8217;m from in Scotland. So that&#8217;s a lovely summer&#8217;s day—2 degrees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />It&#8217;s nothing, right. Alright. And then how is it going with WordCamp Sydney? So, I heard that this is going to be the camp that everyone in Australia and probably New Zealand too—they&#8217;ve been looking forward to this for years. When was the last time of WordCamp Sydney or WordCamps in Australia? If you can share with us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />The last WordCamp in Australia was 2019. I believe it was WordCamp Sydney in 2019, and Perth was due to go ahead in 2020, but that obviously got canceled when COVID struck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Right, right. So, five years, I would say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Five years, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />The last WordCamp Sydney. So I bet everyone is so looking forward to it. And I am guessing also that everyone across Australia is joining forces to help you make it happen. Can you say something about it? How many organizers and where are they from?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />We&#8217;ve got 12 organizers, which is a huge team, but I wanted to get a lot of people involved from all over Australia. So I&#8217;ve got people from Perth, Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney. I think there&#8217;s somebody in Canberra. So, it’s basically all over the major cities, and that&#8217;s really nice. There are a lot of new people on the team. The idea is to train them up and just show them how a conference works, how it&#8217;s organized, so that they can then maybe go back to their own cities and think about putting on a WordCamp in their local city.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />That’s the way to go. So, is this your second, third, fourth, or fifth WordCamp Sydney as an organizer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />2014, 2016, 2018, 2019… Yes, fifth one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Oh wow. You&#8217;re the master of WordCamp Sydney then, and it is about time for you to prepare the next generation, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Right. Someone&#8217;s got to train them up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Exactly. Of course, you’re still around, and they would probably be happy to see you around and helping them out, but I think the younger generation is probably also excited to take up the leadership baton. Wow. And when is it going to happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />November the second and third, which is a Saturday and Sunday, and we are at the University of Technology, Sydney—or we call it UTS—at one of the buildings there. We’ve hosted previous WordCamps in that building, so we kind of know our way around. It was a safe bet rather than trying something new. It is more of a kind of rinse-and-repeat just so we can focus on the event and not on different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Exactly. So you focus on the content, the organizing of the event, and it allows you also to ensure that all the organizing team understands what it takes to hold an event WordPress style. And so two days—let us know what’s going to happen in those two days. Are you going to have Contributor Day on the first day or the second day, or no Contributor Day at all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />I don’t think we’re going to have a Contributor Day at all. I don’t think any of the WordCamps in Australia have done a Contributor Day, but one of the reasons we chose not to do it was because of the budget. Since it’s been five years since the last WordCamp, we weren&#8217;t too sure how many sponsors we&#8217;d get on board. So we just wanted to do the minimal that we could—the two days. If we do get extra sponsorship, then there’s nothing stopping us from hiring another day or another office somewhere and doing a Contributor Day. We can talk about that. Sponsorship’s looking pretty good just now, so yeah, it’s something we can consider and spin up if need be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Alright, so let’s talk about the schedule first. In those two days, what can people expect? Are there going to be full sessions, are there going to be discussions or workshops? And then later on, we’ll touch upon the sponsorship. So what can we expect from the two days of WordCamp?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />It’s going to be two tracks of talks. There may be a panel discussion on one day, but it’s generally going to be two tracks with people talking—slides and sessions. We did think about workshops, but that’s a level up. To do a workshop is quite demanding. You’ve got to have the people there, the resources, the technical equipment. So it’s a different technical challenge from just putting on a talk session. So it&#8217;s something the organizing team is thinking about—how could we implement that for the next WordCamp. We’ve had huge discussions about that, but probably not this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Okay. And you mentioned two tracks. What are they? Is this the common tech and non-tech split?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />No, no, we’re going to mix it up. We started mixing up the tracks, I think, in 2018. We’ve tried in the past to do beginner and dev, or technical and non-technical, but it really depends on the speaker submissions that we get. So we don’t get hundreds—I think we got about 76 speaker submissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />That’s quite a lot! Wow, congratulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yeah, but a lot of them are very developer-focused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Okay, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />So we’re just going to mix it up. We’ll have some dev talks in one room, some dev talks in another, some beginner stuff. So we’ve got people working on the schedule now, going through the speakers. That’s the point we’re at the moment—speaker applications are finished, and we’re reviewing, vetting, and creating the schedule, which should be out in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Alright, so for now we can only expect talks, but who knows? There could be panels or workshops—it depends on the resources, sponsorship as well. And you’re vetting the applications at the moment—out of 70, are you going to reduce it by half or?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />There are about 30 slots available over the two days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Alright, that’s quite a lot! So many people are looking forward to it, yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yeah, that’s good. You mentioned that most of the submissions are developer-focused. This was also one of the inputs that the community team received when we were experimenting with Next Gen events—where some folks were expecting to learn more about developer topics. So, globally, what do you think the expectation or the hope from the community in Australia or the neighboring countries is? What’s the interest at the moment? Do you consider those feedback where people want to hear about certain topics or get involved in certain discussions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yeah, I did a survey for all the meetup groups—maybe two years ago or a year and a half ago. We did get a good development response from that, but we also got quite a large beginner and business response as well. That’s been reflected at the meetups, certainly at the Sydney one. We’re getting quite a few beginners, and we’re getting more business owners coming along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Oh, that’s good, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />We&#8217;ve got people saying, &#8220;We run a website; we want to know more, expand on that.&#8221; So it’s a mix of topics. We’ll definitely cater for beginners, we’ll definitely have some business talks in there, and we’ll try to pad out the development side—we’re okay for development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Good, good, good. And were these submissions coming from other tech community folks? Something related to WordPress? Did you find any in your submission?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yes, absolutely. So we’ve got Girls Who Code—I think we got a submission from them—the Linux Australia open-source community. We had some submissions from them as well. One of the people on the organizing team is a Drupal person, so his community was involved as well. We’re touching on a lot of different communities, a lot of different meetup groups across Australia to advertise. As we said, this is the first one back in five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />So everyone’s excited and wants to be part of it. If not, they just want to see people again, network with people. That sounds exciting—I’m also looking forward to being there. I just have to book my hotel and my flight. It’s two months to go, but I’m still thinking, &#8220;Oh, do I have to spend more just to hang out with folks?&#8221; It sounds like a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me. Although I’ve been to Australia—I lived in Melbourne for two years, but I haven’t quite been to Sydney. I visited my</p>\n\n\n\n<p>relatives in Sydney a bit. So yeah, looking forward to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let&#8217;s go back to sponsors. You mentioned that things are looking good. Are you still in need of more? Do you have a deadline, or are you open to receiving last-minute sponsorship? What’s the situation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />We’ve got the big sponsor package levels, and they always take a lot longer because the bigger companies move a little bit slower. There are a lot more red tape and hoops to go through. So I think we’re okay on the big sponsorships—we’re really looking for more local sponsorships at the moment. So, around the silver, gold, and bronze levels, so we can get that local sponsorship as well, rather than just from all the big companies. We have 93.41% of our expected income from sponsorship at the moment. We can always use more—if we get more, we can open up more rooms, get more speakers, and do workshops or other types of sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Wow!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yeah, so we’re looking very good at the moment. Ticket sales are actually pretty good. We&#8217;ve got—just having a look—we&#8217;ve got 60, 65, 66 tickets sold so far, and that’s with no real push or advertising or speakers. The maximum attendee limit is 333—that’s the venue maximum, so we’re looking okay at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Okay, well, you still have two months to go, and then you’re going to publish all the schedules, speakers probably. So all these sponsors—sponsors also drive people’s decisions. They want to check out the latest products or they just want to connect with their brands, or in fact, they want to give feedback on the product they’ve been using. This is a chance at WordCamp, the networking happens between companies and the customers as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />The networking side has always been huge at the WordCamps in Australia. There are people who will come just to sit out in the corridor and chat to people, and not listen to any sessions, which is fine by us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Yeah, how do you call that? Oh, I can’t remember. How do you call that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />The water cooler?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />It’s the session that happens in the corridor. There’s a term for it, but I can’t think of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Hallway track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Hallway track, there you go! Yes, the hallway track. That’s usually the most favorite one, especially for an event like yours. People have been waiting, and they are excited just to be there, I would say. If not, they are also interested in hearing the latest updates in the industry. Right. Alright. So, I also want to hear more about the community in Australia. Is there anything that we can learn from? How is everything in both Australia and the neighboring New Zealand and the Pacific? There are WordPress communities in these regions, but I think WordCamp Sydney has been the only WordCamp, at least after COVID, that has happened in that part of the world. What do you think about it? How can we support more communities around the region to be more excited to come up with—probably doesn’t have to be as big as WordCamp Sydney with 200-something people, but even 50 to 100 people—we’re so supportive of that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yeah, no, that’s a great point. Obviously, with COVID, the whole community was fragmented and decimated. We lost meetup groups, so I worked with Automattic and WordPress Community Support to spin up those meetup groups again. So we’ve got meetups happening in some of the big cities, which is great. We’ve got Melbourne, Brisbane, and Perth going again with new organizers—fresh talent, which is always great. More meetups are spinning up. We’re always encouraging people that if you want a meetup in your local area, we’re here to help. It’s not as scary as it first seems, and it doesn’t have to be an event with speakers or presenters. It can be in a library or a coffee shop, just chatting. So we’re really encouraging people to spin up local meetups and tailor the community for where it’s at. During COVID, we went online for a couple of years with the WordPress Sydney Meetup, and it worked very well. But maybe it worked a little too well, because it’s a long way to commute. If you&#8217;re outside the Sydney suburbs, it’s like an hour and a half to come into the city center for maybe an hour’s chat. The other cities are the same. So there are a lot of people who really liked the online sessions or being able to watch them at home and catch up. We’ve lost a lot of community members that way, but I’m trying to encourage people that the networking and social side are just as important as the topic or the talk. So I’m encouraging people to meet up and create more local meetups. We had three or four around Greater Sydney before COVID, and some were just a handful of people meeting up in a coffee shop. But that’s great! That’s what we want to encourage—more local meetups rather than always having big WordCamps. If we can build up the community at a local level, the WordCamps and everything else will just take care of themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Yeah, I agree. Right. And do you have anything planned for WordCamp Sydney where you gather all these meetup organizers, or you open up either a discussion or booths for those people who are interested in joining the local community? How do you use WordCamp Sydney as leverage to boost these local initiatives? Is there anything in the plan for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />In 2019, I had little sessions in—it was basically a hallway track. So we had little sessions, and one was Gravity Forms, one was maybe WooCommerce, and just a handful of people would sit down, and we’d chat about something. So I&#8217;d like to do something similar, but along the lines of community and specifically WordPress meetups. So if people are interested, they can come and sit down just for a chat, and I’ll have a skeleton overview of how you can boot up a local WordPress meetup, what types you can do, how to get funding—all that sort of stuff. So I plan to do a little bit of that, a little bit of an unconference, just sitting down with a group of people. But we’re also going to mention the meetup groups at the event as well, because there’ll be a lot of probably ex-meetup organizers there. So there’s a huge talent pool in that room, and a lot of veteran meetup and conference organizers there too. It’d be a bit silly not to engage them. We’ll definitely promote that side as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />That sounds terrific. And I know that the meetup group in Perth has been one of the most active. I was recently in touch with one of the members—I think they’re also speaking at the meetup. With their connection to some community in China, they helped a couple of groups join the official chapter program. So we have Shenzhen Meetup Group now, and there’s an application from Shanghai and others. So, that’s the power of connection. We’re talking about networking, and thanks to folks in Australia, we now have WordPress meetup groups in China. So even small events like a meetup can lead to big achievements as a global community. I’m looking forward to seeing what WordCamp Sydney will result in. Recently—actually yesterday—I saw this social post from the WordPress account, where Josepha Haden was talking about WordPress and education. In some parts of the world, mainly Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia, there are WordCamps or WordPress events that involve students—university students, kids, and the younger generation in general. Is there any direction that you’re introducing at WordCamp Sydney, whether through the session topics, the speakers, or any activities that would involve or allow kids to join and participate? If not, that’s totally fine, but if yes, or if there’s still an opportunity—given that there’s still sponsorship available to support your event—this could be something interesting for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />It’s definitely something we discussed, but we’re not going to do a kids track this year. Again, we’re just trying to keep it as simple as we can to test the model again, to see if it still works. So there’ll be no kids track, but certainly students. I’ve contacted some people that I know in TAFE to try and get that student side as well. Also, one of our sponsors is offering travel grants on an application basis. I think they’re offering 10 travel grants, particularly for people who can’t afford to get into the city, like students. That’s on the website homepage—you can have a look at that. But that’s to encourage people who would maybe like to come to WordCamp but can’t quite afford it or don’t have the finances. So, students would definitely fit into that category. We’re encouraging that. We’ve always had a strong student membership, because local colleges use WordPress a lot in their courses to spin up a website and do projects within WordPress. So we’ve always had that strong student connection, and we want to grow that again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />That sounds good. There’s a lot of opportunities. It’s great that you have sponsors willing to offer travel grants for WordCamp Sydney. Okay. This is fantastic, and I hope that all the seats are taken by those who are really in need of the support and who will benefit from your event. This is fantastic. Alright, so where can we learn more about Word</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Camp Sydney, other than the website? Are you on social media?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yes, we’re on social media. Let me just pull it up. The hashtag is <a rel=\"tag\" class=\"hashtag u-tag u-category\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/tag/wcsyd/\">#WCSyd</a>. We’re on X (formerly Twitter) as WordCampSYD, and we’re on Facebook as well—same handle. We’re also on LinkedIn. If you just search for WordCamp Sydney, it’ll come up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Right. I’m actually scrolling down—usually where you see the social buttons, and I see Meetup is the first button, then Facebook, then X, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Instagram. This is a set of social accounts for WordCamp Sydney—wow! Who’s the person, who’s the organizer behind this communication or marketing? Kudos to that person. This is awesome. And I see that you are collaborating with Linux Australia. This is, I think, a very unique setup. I don’t think this is evident in many parts of the world. There are some communities collaborating with local tech communities, but WordCamp Sydney, or WordPress in Australia, has been one of the experiences in this kind of collaboration. Is there anything you can share about this—when you started, how you started this collaboration, and how you maintain it? Of course, there would be probably some admin involved or hiccups in the collaboration—that&#8217;s the dynamic, right, of teamwork. I see this as teamwork and collaboration to keep the WordPress community alive in Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />So we’ve got a memorandum of understanding between WordPress Community Support or WordCamp Central and Linux Australia. Linux Australia supports all the open-source communities in Australia. They’re huge and very helpful as well. They run our event insurance, and we run the bank accounts through Linux Australia too. This means we don’t have to deal with currency exchange rates, and the insurance here in Australia—to get a venue—you usually need $20 million in insurance coverage. WordCamp Central, I believe, can only do $10 million. So, Linux Australia covers us for event insurance. They’ve been fantastic supporters. As well as having our WordPress community in Australia, we’re also linked into the whole open-source community via Linux Australia. So we’re broadcasting out to all of Australia, not just to the WordPress niche. They&#8217;ve been absolutely fantastic. It does mean a little bit more admin—we have to form a subcommittee within Linux Australia, which needs a treasurer and a secretary at a minimum, and we then have to report monthly back to Linux Australia, just to show how progress is going. So we’re kind of serving two masters at once—we’ve got WordCamp Central, and we’ve got Linux Australia. But that’s not a bad thing, because it’s double accountability. We’ve got the WordCamp Central team looking at budgets, and we’ve got Linux Australia looking at budgets as well. So, it’s a little more admin, but it’s double accountability, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />I think you mentioned the community. Does it also support the meetup groups as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Linux Australia offers grants. I was vice president of Linux Australia for a couple of years, and every year they offer grants. As of last year, they split it into software grants and community grants. So, if we do have local open-source meetups, WordPress meetups, they can help financially with venues, AV advice, and support. So, there’s huge support available to us through Linux Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />That sounds good. And is this an initiative from Linux Australia to nurture the open-source community in Australia, supporting them? So it’s not that everyone needs to compete to get support or get recognized—they’re like a welcoming umbrella for other open-source communities and supporting whatever programs those communities have. Do you know if a similar initiative takes place in other countries, for example with the Linux Foundation, or if there are similar activities elsewhere? Because this could actually be a good entry point for other WordPress communities where the Linux Foundation or association in the city or country is strong, but they’ve never connected. But perhaps either the WordPress community or someone else could reach out and start that collaboration. Do you know anything?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />I don’t know of any other countries where the Linux group supports WordPress directly, but if anyone’s listening and they’re interested, I’m happy to have a chat with them and maybe funnel things through Linux Australia, and see if we can get in contact with other countries or groups. But yeah, the system works really well for us—it’s not a burden having two teams for accountability. They’re really helpful, and the resources are fantastic. It just works really, really well for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Alright, well that sounds like a very good model to follow. If you have any resources you can share regarding this collaboration, I think that would be great to share in the Community Events channel or the Community Team’s channel, so that everyone else can look it up and see whether they can reach out to their own Linux Foundation or association in their country. Alright, anything that I missed about WordCamp Sydney that we have to talk about? I see this “Plan Your Pitch Online Workshop.” What is it? Is this a pre-event or a day-of-the-event workshop?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />That was held a couple of weeks ago. We extended the speaker applications for a couple of weeks—not because we didn’t have enough, but just to give people the chance to submit more sessions. We also contacted more diverse communities. That workshop was given by a couple of the organizers, and it was basically an info session to show people how to create a pitch for a speaker application—not just for WordCamp, but for any conference—to give them confidence on what to put in a speaker pitch and how to put together a proposal to send off to a conference. For a first-time speaker, that can be quite daunting—you might not know what to put in a speaker application to push yourself forward and get noticed. So, the event showed people what a speaker proposal is, what things you need to include, what’s going to get you noticed, and how to apply. It was well attended, and we’ll probably wrap it up as a general webinar and put it out as a resource for people to reference. For example, if there’s another WordCamp next year, they can point to that resource or run it themselves if they want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />So we’ll be able to see the recording later on the WordCamp Sydney website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Yep, we’ll get it up there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />This is super helpful. Thank you so much. I see that Daniel and Jo Minney hosted the event. Okay, wow. Alright, so is there anything else we missed? Anything else you want to share about WordCamp Sydney, things we should look forward to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Oh look, at the end of the day, it’s a big networking event. Yes, there’s the bonus that you get to hear some tracks and people talk, but the main point is just to get people back together, back to networking, back to being social. It’s one of the cheapest tech conferences in Australia—WordCamp itself. Sometimes people see the ticket price and think, “Oh, it’s just 70 bucks,” but the amount of value you get out of that is outstanding. As well as the two tracks over the two days, we’ve got morning tea, lunch, and afternoon tea included, and there’s a social event on the Saturday evening as well for people to attend. So, extra networking brownie points for people who want to do that. It’s a huge conference with a lot of networking opportunities. I’d really encourage people to think about that. Even if some of the speaker sessions don’t quite align with what you do, come down just for the networking. The networking is the big thing—it’s the social aspect. I’m a freelancer, I work on my own. This is my office—my bedroom—so I spend 90% of my time in here. But it’s good to get out to local meetups and chat with other people. It’s good to get out to conferences and network with other people. It’s all about that social and network connection. Some of my best friends I met through meetup groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Alright, well I’m excited to meet you in person. We’ve been in touch since last year, since I think the BW reactivation in 2022, so that’s actually two years ago. And I look forward to Wapuus as well—you mentioned you still have a lot of Wapuus in Australia! So that’s something else I’m looking forward to, and meeting folks in Australia. Alright, I think it’s been a really great evening here, catching up with Wil and listening to what we can look forward to from WordCamp Sydney. There are still two months to go, but it’s the right time to start getting tickets, booking your hotel, booking your flight, and following all these social media accounts for WordCamp Sydney so that you don’t miss anything. It’s networking, right? The big thing for WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Networking is the big thing. So come and network your heart out. Looking forward to meeting everyone there. It’ll be good fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Alright, well, thank you so much, Wil. Good to see you online, and I’ll see you in two months in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />See you in person in two months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Devin:<br />Yeah, alright.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil:<br />Thank you, Devin.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, <strong>Devin</strong> chats with <strong>Wil Brown</strong>, a seasoned WordCamp organizer, about the return of <strong>WordCamp Sydney </strong>after a five-year hiatus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wil shares updates on the event&#8217;s organization, including the diverse team of organizers from across Australia, the challenges of planning in a post-COVID world, and the focus on rebuilding local WordPress communities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also discuss what attendees can expect from the two-day event, covering everything from speaker sessions and networking opportunities to the importance of community-driven initiatives and sponsorships that make the event possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordCamp Sydney&#8217;s Return After 5 Years</strong>: The last WordCamp in Australia took place in 2019, and WordCamp Sydney is making a long-awaited comeback, with excitement building across Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Organizing a Large Event:</strong> Wil leads a diverse team of 12 organizers from all over Australia, and the event is expected to draw a large crowd. The team’s goal is not only to deliver a successful event but to train future organizers who can take WordCamps to their own cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Focus on Networking</strong>: Beyond the speaker tracks, the primary focus of WordCamp Sydney is on networking. Many attendees come specifically for the opportunity to connect with others in the WordPress and broader tech community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Two Days of Talks and Discussions</strong>: The event will have two tracks of talks, including a mix of technical and non-technical sessions. While workshops were considered, the team decided to focus on talks to streamline planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sponsorships and Financial Support</strong>: Wil highlighted the role of sponsors in making the event accessible, with 93.41% of the expected sponsorship already secured. They are also offering travel grants to support students and others who may need financial help to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Local Community Growth</strong>: Rebuilding local meetups post-COVID has been a priority, with efforts to encourage more local WordPress communities to form and grow. Wil emphasizes that smaller, informal meetups are just as valuable as larger events like WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Collaboration with Linux Australia</strong>: WordCamp Sydney benefits from a strong collaboration with Linux Australia, which provides financial and logistical support, including event insurance and grants for local open-source meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Encouraging First-Time Speakers</strong>: Wil and his team have hosted workshops to help first-time speakers craft and submit their talk proposals, fostering a more diverse speaker lineup and encouraging new voices in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/developerwil/\">Wil on WordPress.org</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilbrownau/\">Wil on LinkedIn</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://sydney.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCamp Sydney 2024</a></strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://sydney.wordcamp.org/2024/tickets/\">Get your ticket</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://sydney.wordcamp.org/2024/sponsors/\">Sponsor</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://sydney.wordcamp.org/2024/schedule/\">Schedule</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 17 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: WooSesh 2024 Scheduled for October 29 and 30\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=161941\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wptavern.com/woosesh-2024-scheduled-for-october-29-and-30\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2795:\"<p><a href=\"https://woosesh.com/\">WooSesh</a>, the virtual conference specifically designed for WooCommerce store builders, is scheduled for October 29-30, 2024, and promises an exciting experience.

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Music intro)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:39]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong>&nbsp;Folks, this week is WordCamp US, and over the past week or so, I spent a fair amount of time talking to people about that first-time experience. And as with any person who&#8217;s talking about their version of a shared experience, I started thinking back to mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think my first experience of WordPress was not typical, though. I had never even heard of WordPress when I first went to a WordCamp. I think, I think most of the time people have heard of it before, but I was just there for the plot. So, like many people in my generation, all of us old people of the internet, I was first online with things like Angelfire and GeoCities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:16] <strong>Josepha:</strong> When I went to college, I was keeping friends and family up to date on what I was up to with a little, like, newsletter? And then Xanga made it to our college campus, and eventually, so did Facebook. And I was one of those kids kind of like half-breaking sites with HTML and CSS I found online. I was changing layouts like every week to suit my mood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, when I graduated and found myself in a city with more talent and more competition than I&#8217;d actually accounted for, and started to realize that this online stuff I&#8217;d been doing for fun might actually be something that I needed to use as a tool professionally. So, I first went out and reserved my screen name everywhere I could think of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And we&#8217;re talking, like, LiveJournal, WordPress.com, Blogger, all the things, and eventually wound up building my first site on Weebly. And it was super ugly. I&#8217;m not able to design things. I have an okay sense for a design that is good, but like, left to my own devices, it&#8217;s gonna be what that was, which is like a tie dye background for some reason, and had everything organized into little, like, blocks, I guess? You know, like, old magazine layouts? And it technically had everything that I wanted, but it wasn&#8217;t necessarily the best version of any of those things either. I could write a little bit about myself and my services, I could add a few photos, there was a way to contact me, and I could do it all by myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it was a good place to start. Not long after that, though, I graduated into the need for a more professional-looking website, and it was beautiful. I received a website; someone built it for me. It was beautiful; it had this elegant design. Had a lot of custom functionality, but it was built using ColdFusion. I couldn&#8217;t do anything to it. I couldn&#8217;t change anything. All minor changes just had to kind of wait until there was enough to make sense to use that maintenance time, that maintenance retainer that I had. It really was just kind of formal. It was an isolated snapshot of all of the sorts of information that was required to be on the web at that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then, later that year, I went to my first WordCamp, and I moved my site over to WordPress. And for the first time, I had that kind of mixture of professional expression that was on top of something that enabled my own expression. And honestly, I didn&#8217;t learn much more about the software for a few years. It was doing what I needed it to do, how I needed it to be done, and that&#8217;s really what mattered to me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I skip a few years ahead after that, a few years later, when I was learning by organizing Meetups and WordCamps that had speakers that I wanted to hear from, that had topics that I felt like I needed to learn more about, what I remember most about that learning period for me is that I knew that I wasn&#8217;t the first person to run into any of my problems, which meant that a solution was probably already out there, and I could find someone to come and teach us about their solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And also, I knew that if we were running into a new problem and started breaking things left and right, there was always a way back. I was never really too far away from success. Like I felt like I might be lost, but I still was pretty much findable. And I guess I always want that for new users of the open web now, like new members of our WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want them to feel like the breaking of things is fine and safe and that no mistake is irretrievable. I want us to have some place where perfection isn&#8217;t the point. Now listen, I know the software is complex right now. The admin is a little mismatched, your first choices are huge choices, and there are a million places to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, all I can say is, start with what you need, and once you&#8217;ve got that, like the back of your hand, move on to what you need next. And keep doing that, bravely and messily, until what you&#8217;ve got is all you ever wanted. I&#8217;m gonna leave for you, in the show notes, a link to something called WordPress Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s gonna launch a little WordPress site in your browser. There will be no host. It&#8217;s just all in the browser itself. And it will have the latest bundled theme on it, Twenty Twenty-Four, and the latest version of WordPress. And that&#8217;s it. Go in there and click around on the left-hand menu. Start a post, change a page, modify the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just play around a while. See if it&#8217;s something that seems fun to you or valuable, or if it&#8217;s something that you can use as a time capsule for your kid because that sounds like a nice little mix of fun and work. And remember, sometimes perfection&#8217;s not the point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:57] (Music interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Folks, as I mentioned at the top, WordCamp US is happening this week. It is September 17th through 20th this year, quite a few more days. But that also means that we&#8217;ll have quite a bit more stuff to do. If you have your tickets and haven&#8217;t looked at all of the presentations occurring over the four-day event, remember to take a look at the schedule and pick out topics that are interesting. And remember, just because you picked it out before you went doesn&#8217;t mean that if you get in there and it doesn&#8217;t work for you. You can&#8217;t choose a different topic while you&#8217;re there. And as a bonus, if this is your first WordCamp that you&#8217;ve ever attended, I have you covered. You can check out my previous episode on all the things to remember for your first time attending a WordCamp. And we have a pretty active community as well. If you just have questions or want to get in there and say, &#8216;Hey, I&#8217;m going to a vegan restaurant for lunch; who wants to join me?&#8217; You can do that, and you can definitely find somebody. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, there are some upcoming WordPress meetings. So, if you&#8217;re not attending WordCamp US but still want to connect with the community, there are a ton of team meetings that are happening. You can find those on make.WordPress.org/meetings, I think. So really, really easy URL to remember. You can join your fellow community members and contribute to the WordPress project there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And I also wanted to just call your attention to a few really big projects that still need a little bit of help around the project. So, on the one hand, we have Data Liberation. That is still a really big project, but specifically, we are nearly ready to start working on some user-facing elements of that. It is being powered by Playground, and because the data liberation, the migration of one site to another, is so complex, once we get those elements built into Playground, I think it also stands to fix a bunch of the problems that we have across our user flow, our user experience for the project. Things like having better theme previews and being able to get a sense for what a plugin functionally will do for you versus what it says it&#8217;s going to do for you. And getting a sense for what the admin looks like, all of those things. And so, anyone who wants to learn more about contributing to Playground or to Data Liberation, I absolutely encourage you to go check out those meetings, see what&#8217;s happening, and get your hands a bit dirty with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We also have a bunch of stuff happening in our community space. If you had received this podcast from somebody because they were like, hey, I know someone who might like WordPress or who has just learned WordPress and has never been to an event or any other reason that you are listening to this but don&#8217;t yet know the community, there is an easier option than just jumping straight into a WordCamp like I did. You can go to a meetup. You can see there&#8217;s a widget in your dashboard that&#8217;ll tell you what your nearest event is, but if you put your location into that widget, and nothing comes up. Technically, that means that you have an opportunity to bring a bunch of people together to teach you stuff you wish you knew about your site right now. So you can wander over into your dashboard and see those, or you can also head over to the community area on make.WordPress.org and anybody over there is happy to help you get started. And let me tell you, it is a very low-effort sort of thing to do. Here again, perfection&#8217;s not the point. And so that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there is a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser. Or, if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I am your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks. Or tomorrow if we&#8217;re all going to WordCamp US.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:58] (Music outro)</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 16 Sep 2024 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Brett McSherry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"HeroPress: WordCamp Nairobi, Call For Speakers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=7402\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"https://heropress.com/wordcamp-nairobi-call-for-speakers/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordcamp-nairobi-call-for-speakers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3264:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"501\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/event-about-pg-banner-b-1024x501.webp\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"WordCamp Nairobu Banner\" /><p>I noticed recently that WordCamp Nairobi is on the calendar for 1-2 November.

If you can attend you should apply to speak, we need as many voices as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recently met with Moses Cursor Ssebunya, Patrick Lumumba, and Emmanuel Lwanga, all organizers of the WordCamp. If you see them, say hi and shake their hand for me. It sounds like it&#8217;s going to be a great event.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id7402_480b32-d4 alignfull has-theme-palette1-background-color kt-row-has-bg

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Developer Hours, we will talk about Playground, and we will talk about Gutenberg 19.2, as well as some DataViews and design systems. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and a full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source project, sponsored by Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s again a special pleasure to have Maggie Cabrera with me. She&#8217;s a theme and core contributor and also sponsored by Automatic. And you work in the community also with the themes, or have been. You&#8217;re always a good supporter for theme developers, so welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you so much for taking the time today. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: I&#8217;m good, thank you. Thanks for inviting me again. And yeah, I mainly work in core, but themes are very special for me, and very dear to my heart. So, whenever there&#8217;s an opportunity to help out with the community or anything, I&#8217;m there. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. And I also see that there are quite a few themes coming from Automatic for the theme repository in all kinds of different shapes. So, I&#8217;m really happy that it inspires a lot of people to do very specific themes. Not this overall, everything looks the same block themes, but have some for WooCommerce, have some for a print, and have some for somebody who wants to do just public scripts, movie scripts, or something like that. It&#8217;s quite interesting what&#8217;s coming out like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. We&#8217;ve been working on submitting a lot of themes that the designers have been working throughout the year, and I&#8217;ve been impressed when reviewing them technically, the amount of talent that the designers have and how much they can actually express while working in the editor. And I see how both the designers and the editor have matured over the years, and it&#8217;s so lovely to see what you could do three years ago and what you can do now. It&#8217;s just so amazing, I just love it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Can&#8217;t wait for the next 3, 4, 5 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, yeah, and it&#8217;s also the speed with going from idea and the overall design, and then, all of a sudden, it&#8217;s a theme that you can publish on the WordPress repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. The designers don&#8217;t use Figma anymore, they just go jump on the site editor and they start the site editor, the edit in site editor, and then, with Playground, they generate a PR that we review for the technical stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Uh-huh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> So, the themes make it through the theme directory guidelines, because there&#8217;s like, you need to add the license for the images and the assets and all that stuff. But, in general, most of the work is done in the editor and there&#8217;s barely any code that needs to be touched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes, it&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> It&#8217;s amazing to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. And Beatriz Fialho, she demonstrated that in a recent Hallway Hangout, how that connection works between the Create Block Theme plugin and then the Playground and then the GitHub PRs. Yeah, so, how these three tools actually work together, and that&#8217;s quite interesting, too, how streamlined the process is. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: And it&#8217;s only getting better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah, getting better and better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so, we have a few announcements, dear listeners, and well, I have a section here that says listener questions and we haven&#8217;t gotten any listener questions lately. So, if you have a question, just send them to <a href=\"mailto:Changelog@GutenbergTimes.com\">Changelog@GutenbergTimes.com</a> or ping me on the WordPress Slack or on Twitter if you have a question that you want the answer to, and we can answer them here at the podcast here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Developer Hours<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So, today I have a few announcements. The Developer Hours, a first look at a new API that will come with WordPress 6.7, and that is the Template Registration API for plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until now, plugins had a really hard time getting templates into the block theme, the site editor, so they can be offered to the site owner or designers to use whatever comes in the plugin, also for the front end. And there was a developer ask last week about that and also a Developer Blog article about how to do this in various detail. Mind you, WordPress 6.7 hasn&#8217;t been out yet, but it was in Gutenberg 19.1, so that was the Developer Hours last week, or this week? This week, sorry, September 10th. Today is September 12th. I haven&#8217;t followed that example in the Developer Blog post yet completely, but I can see how that really makes it a difference when you, for instance, have a plugin with a custom post type as well as custom fields. You can also provide all that already in a template, both for the single post of your custom post type, as well as for the archive template. So, your plugin is pretty much ready to be used with any block theme, or also for classic themes, of course, if you want to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, the next Developer Hour is on September 24th and, as always, on 1500 UTC, that&#8217;s 11:00 AM Eastern. It&#8217;s about the introduction to DataViews. And it&#8217;s not so much the introduction in what&#8217;s in the site editor now, but it&#8217;s more like how you can use the DataViews component as part of your own plugin for the settings page, or when you handle other data that&#8217;s coming in from a different source like from an API, say, on the internet. So, the Developer Hours will cover the fundamentals of DataViews component, how to add a React app to the WordPress admin page, and how to display a custom datasets using the DataView component. And, there will be a Q&amp;A session, and there&#8217;s also already a post on the Developer Blog for the first part of it, like using DataViews to display and interact with data and plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s September 24th, 1500 UTC. And I&#8217;ll share, of course, all the links in the show notes, not only the RSVP for the Developer Hour, but also the article for the Developer Blog. And I will also share the subscribe to the Developer Blog links, so we&#8217;ll never miss a post again. And also, I will share the link to the Developer Hours YouTube playlist, so you can go back and say, &#8220;Oh, which Developer Hours have I missed?&#8221; or, &#8220;Oh, there was a Developer Hour, I need to learn this.&#8221; So, it&#8217;s actually pretty cool to have those resources all available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Developer Blog, there&#8217;s the newest &#8220;What&#8217;s New For Developers&#8221; roundup post available since September 10th, and it has about 25 different changes for plugin developers as well as themes. Some of them about 6.6.2, other ones are coming from Gutenberg 19.0 or Gutenberg release 19.1 and they&#8217;re divided up between plugin and tools or theme developers. Some things are also good for both, but you&#8217;ll figure that out. But it&#8217;s just a rundown of developer relevant things that coming into WordPress before WordPress 6.7 comes out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that was a whole thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thank you Maggie for being so patient. Any comments about things you want to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, I was just looking at the What&#8217;s New For Developers and I think those are so useful to keep up with all the changes in Gutenberg and core because so much happens in so little time and it&#8217;s kind of hard to follow everything and be able to know what you can benefit from in your themes or in your plugins or whatever implementations that you&#8217;re making. So, yeah, it&#8217;s so good to have that all condensed and easy to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, thank you. Yeah. Yeah, there&#8217;s a whole group of writers on the Developer Blog that are working on it and we are scouting all the things that come out of the teams being the releases or comments to core, but even then, we miss things. So, if you find something that we missed, don&#8217;t hesitate to let us know. We&#8217;ll just add it to it or bring it into the next one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Roundup post comes out always on the 10th of the month, so October 10th is the next one that will come out, and I think the designated writer, we are working on a team on this, but the designated writer will be Nick Diego, and he&#8217;s leaving right now for WordCamp US. But, yeah, he will be back and then start writing, but we are all contributing to that. We have a whole list of things where we just copy paste things from release or from track tickets and then we need to do some research and then have the little blurb there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Roadmap 6.7<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, well, speaking of 6.7, the roadmap 6.7 has been out and Anne has published it on September 3rd. That was pretty much a few days after Jessica Lyshek and I were wondering if there will be a roadmap post at all before Beta One, but there is, so we are going through it fast because it&#8217;s a long post anyway, so we might as go fast, but we also will cover it in the next episode after the next one. So, this is 107. We will cover it in 109 when we&#8217;re going to record it around October 10th, that&#8217;s when Beta Two was out for 6.7. Beta One is October 1st and then, October 8th will be Beta Two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the roadmap, the first thing that comes up is of course the new default theme. Have you looked at it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> What they&#8217;re working on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I&#8217;ve not been following it as much as I would&#8217;ve liked because I&#8217;ve been busy, but been looking at the design and a little bit at the repo and I am, as always, very impressed with the design work and how ambitious this thing looks like, even though I think Twenty Twenty Four was really ambitious, I think this one&#8217;s outdoing it because look at the amount of patterns there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> There&#8217;s so many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I know for a fact how hard they are to build in such a short period of time to the standards that we expect the default team to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> It&#8217;s a great work being done there. So, for sure, if anyone&#8217;s listening is interested in theming, go and have a look at the repo and check the work being done there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So, how many patterns are there? I can&#8217;t even count them. Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s really a lot. Yeah, so we probably need to do a review of all the patterns at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Oh yeah. I&#8217;m looking at the repo and I&#8217;m scrolling through all the ones that are mentioned. It&#8217;s long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, and I like the…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I think it&#8217;s at least double what Twenty Twenty Four has, or close to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Oh yeah, at least. Yeah. What I see is also the name of the patterns are quite revealing, so you know pretty much what&#8217;s going to be in there, but I like the vertical header. We haven&#8217;t talked about vertical headers yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And so, really, really excited about about trying that out, and then, it has a poster section and I can read a few patterns for a photo blog and then portfolio and newsletter, sign up. That&#8217;s kind of standard, so I&#8217;m tempted to install it and make it&#8230; Put it up on one of my technical blogs and try it out and see what&#8217;s coming out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: If you give it a couple weeks, you will have an odd version that&#8217;s decent enough to start doing your thing because it doesn&#8217;t have any functionality in it. What you will be missing, it&#8217;s probably going to be minor stuff like translation on patterns and, yeah, maybe you will be missing some accessibility fixes and stuff like that, but you will have most of the design on that version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent, excellent. Yeah, so, well it&#8217;s going to be two weeks until I actually get to do some of that. Yeah. And then, what&#8217;s also going to be in 6.7 is definitely a refinement of the DataViews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And some of them is the extensibility that you can extend or register and unregister some of the actions that are in there via plugins. I know that that&#8217;s already in there, because it was in Gutenberg and that&#8217;s going to be in 6.7 as well. Yeah, the grid layout in the DataViews to follow the aspect ratios and there are quite a few interesting developments there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next one is something that is definitely exciting, that&#8217;s the polishing of the query loop where there are additional features in there, like the offsets and all that. Putting it from the toolbar into the sidebar and all that. So, that is always good because some of the features actually confuse me and other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>So&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> And if they confuse us who are quite used to interacting with it often enough, I can&#8217;t imagine for someone that encountered it for the first time. Yeah, I think that&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I like that too, yeah. We have been talking about this podcast about some of the Zoom Out experience and that the team has been working on it. We will see if it makes it at whole or just in parts, and it&#8217;s an experience where, when you select a pattern, for instance, that your canvas zooms out and shows you more of your page than the normal editor would show you so you can add the pattern easily and see it in relation to other things. I think that&#8217;s a great feature. I just don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s defined, that there are sections and what if I want to edit, then I have a different mode. And so, it&#8217;s all a little bit, yeah, we need to figure that out, and as long as I&#8217;m confused&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, I understand. We&#8217;re working on that and Zoom Out is already in core, it&#8217;s just that the way to access it is not as straightforward as anyone would think. Every time you go on global styles, you will trigger Zoom Out when you&#8217;re browsing the style book, I think it is. But the mode is there. The code is, it&#8217;s just, the thing is, how are we going to surface this to the users? That&#8217;s most of the main thing that we&#8217;re discussing is, how do we want the users to experience Zoom Out? So, depending on where we are when we&#8217;re closer to the release, we&#8217;ll figure out if it stays somewhat hidden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, right now, I think there&#8217;s a button that you can click in the preview. We&#8217;re iterating on that. I think, right now, it&#8217;s on the preview, but I think that&#8217;s going to move. It&#8217;s no longer in the patterns. I think we&#8217;ve moved out of that because we thought that you might want to not have it trigger if you have a theme that has patterns that are not full sections and you want to insert patterns inside patterns, which wasn&#8217;t really working with the Zoom Out view, but still, we also want to&#8230; We&#8217;re working on, there&#8217;s an open issue that we&#8217;re still iterating on and I think it&#8217;s going to move into an experiment, to add Zoom Out when you are creating a new page so that, instead of having this pop-up that shows you&#8230; Like, Twenty Twenty Four has four or five versions of a page. Instead of having that pop-up every time, you would actual go into pattern insertion mode and you would just build your page using the pattern. So, you have, or you can toggle that out and just write a new page with just text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, we&#8217;re still&#8230; The mode is there and still needs polishing and all that, but mainly what we&#8217;re iterating is what we want the user experience to be. So, we cannot really predict what exactly is going to land, but some of it will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, there&#8217;s some great testing going around and if you want to test that out, I&#8217;m sure we can just install the Gutenberg plugin 19.2 and then play around with it and see what works for you and what doesn&#8217;t. And, if you pay attention, sometimes it&#8217;s hard to narrow down why you all feel trapped or confused or something like that, but it&#8217;s hard to describe that. But if you can, that would be really helpful for the designers and the developers to figure out where&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, feedback is more than welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Absolutely, yeah, and if someone has an idea in mind as to how they would think they could benefit from this. They are a plugin author and they think they could use this for something, idea that they have, then that&#8217;s more than welcome, too, because we think we know the blows people will want to go through, but we are probably not thinking what everyone else has in mind. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> No, I understand. So, the 6.7 also will come with some media improvements. We talked about the HEIC images that are automatically converted to JPEGs. Then, auto size of lazy loading and some background attachments or fixed backgrounds that are on the block level as well, and, of course, need to be uploaded in the media library and all that kind of thing. Yeah, and then, the meta boxes in the iFrame post editor. There is a PR and Anne has shared the links to that, how meta box is going to be, because we talked about it here a bit that the post editor and the side editor become one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> But it&#8217;s a little bit tricky when the post editor has meta boxes on the bottom, then, it loads it not in the iFrame. The iFrame is the unified canvas or editor, but if it&#8217;s not in the iFrame, then some of the things are not working like they are in the editor. So, the interfaces are, all of a sudden, don&#8217;t match. So, they&#8217;re kind of trying to figure out that, and I think they found a good solution with two sections in the editor and the post editor where the block editor is on top, and underneath, they have an additional window there. It&#8217;s going to be interesting to see, but I think with the block bindings UI that&#8217;s coming in 19.2, some of it is offset because those are a better interface to connect with post meta data or other custom fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, what else is the design tools? Everybody&#8230; No, not everybody. Every block gets border controls now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, you can&#8230; Yeah, we ran through the list here quite often and those are all coming to the WordPress 6.7 and it also stabilizes some of the block supports because some of them, they were still in experimental status, especially topography supports features, and they will come out of experimental status, so more people can use them now in their own custom blocks or for block variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked about template registration API, that&#8217;s coming, and then, we will talk about the preview options and then updates to the interactivity API and the block bindings API. And another one is the HTML API. So, it&#8217;s a lot of&#8230; It&#8217;s definitely, again, with the last three of them, developer heavy, but there are great improvements for the interfaces and for the contact creators and the designers in the site editor. So, that is going to be WordPress 6.7 and we are going to dive into it in episode 109. That&#8217;s two episodes from now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, back to our program here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.6.2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> First, what&#8217;s released? It was WordPress 6.6.2, and it had 26 fixes, 15 in core or in track, identified in track and 11 identified in the Gutenberg repo for the block editor, and some maintenance security release. But some of the fixes are bug fixes for things that were in 6.6 and dealt with the lower CSS specificity. That changed a few sites that looked a little bit different, and now, the bug fixes are in. There were quite a few in 6.6.1, and now 6.6.2, has caught up with the other ones. And then, there&#8217;s a bug fix for the derivative state in the interactivity API and, yeah, some are for the post editor rendering in the iFrame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release post has the whole list of things that&#8217;s in there and what&#8217;s new for developers. I&#8217;ve written a few sentences about the bug fixes that are relevant for our theme developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 19.2</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That gets us to Gutenberg 19.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>193 PRs, 58 bug fixes, and 59 enhancements. 54 contributors contributed to them. Six of them are first-time contributors, so it&#8217;s always good to have first time contributors. I am so happy…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Oh, it&#8217;s&#8230; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; they are identified and in the release post so you can scroll down and learn more about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yep. So, do you want to lead us for the first one?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Move bulk actions menu to the filter and consolidate with floating tool and total items display?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yeah, that&#8217;s part of the database, and it is&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I think the biggest problem with the data views is that they want that on that real estate on the screen&#8230; Do everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And now, it&#8217;s all very top-lastic and now I need to give it a little bit more space, so they moved the bulk actions to the footer, and it&#8217;s really interesting to see how that comes about when you do it in incremental, and somebody should do a video, how it&#8217;s going to work from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> It&#8217;s hard, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The first few to the next one, that&#8217;s probably going to be fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Cool. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>I think, in general, there&#8217;s also this constant concern in the editor in general. You want to give the users as many options as they can while keeping things simple. And then, do you want to hide things that are not something that you use all the time, but still users need to know they are there when they need them. So, it&#8217;s a constant&#8230; It&#8217;s a balancing act, to not overcrowd the UI while still giving the users a really powerful tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Definitely. And, with the admin pages, it comes that there&#8217;s a 20-year history, what these listings on the admin pages can do, so that needs…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> You need to be able to do everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah, and extend it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>&#8230; I think that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s going to be in mind for 6.8 or 6.9, that, once the DataView component is&#8230; But it&#8217;s also one single component that&#8217;s really hard to do. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important for people to start trying and adopting it early so they can influence the development early on, because, yeah, it needs to be very extendable. So, the best way to do it properly is giving feedback so that the core contributors actually have in mind the needs of plugin developers. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> That&#8217;s very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, so, there is composite component that comes in, too, that had a few PRs in 19.2, but the bigger PR is going to be merged in 19.3 and it will come out in two weeks. So, you will find some of the references interesting because they say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t use the composite AI.&#8221; So, what is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there&#8217;s a new version. Sometimes, a component has run its course and needs to be refactored and one of those is the drop-down menu version 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been looking at that. It looks so good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Sometimes you really need to learn from things, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I also have the feeling, especially in software development, when you do go new routes, that the first time you never get it really right, because it teaches you how it wants to be done, whatever you&#8217;re going to do. And then, the second time, you get it right and you learn from that and then you iterate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> You&#8217;re always iterating, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, you cannot settle with the first version of the thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Correct. Yeah. I will share a link to the drop-down menu version 2 tracking issue on Gutenberg, so you see what&#8217;s all in the works and where the vision goes. And I will also share the Storybook. It&#8217;s not Storyboard, it&#8217;s Storybook, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Storybook, yeah. Yeah, it&#8217;s Storybook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Storybook, yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m always getting Stylebook, Storyboard, Storybook…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; totally confused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Actually, it&#8217;s Storyboard, you are right, it is Storyboard. I&#8217;m thinking of Storybook because it&#8217;s…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, so it&#8217;s&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Is it confusing now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Well, you provide a link so people will know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. No matter what, just click on the link and then you get there, and I really have been discovering the storyboard. It&#8217;s been a while since I discovered it, but it was a component work. It&#8217;s so good to go there instead of reading the documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Oh, yeah, I do it all&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; in the block editor handbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I use it all the time. All the time. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So, why do you do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Well, when we&#8217;re developing and we need to touch a component or there&#8217;s a component that I&#8217;ve never worked with, sometimes, I just don&#8217;t even know what attributes are available to me and it&#8217;s so much easier to just checking the Storybook because it&#8217;s just more visual than actually going into the remi and all that stuff. I will eventually do that too, but it feels easier for me to&#8230; I&#8217;m more of a visual person, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. And me, too. Yeah, and seeing things in action and you can put in values in certain things and then see how the component behaves as a standalone component. You don&#8217;t see it acting in context and that&#8217;s sometimes really good because you can isolate how your interface is going to be. So, yeah, I really like that. Yeah, so, I&#8217;m going to share that in the show notes so you can look at that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. The next one is the block bindings UI. So, there is a pull request to only allow admin for now, admin users to create and modify bindings by default. There is a discussion going on the track ticket to get it into core about, is it really necessary to go for the admin role or shouldn&#8217;t we go for capabilities? And when capabilities, which one is it? Is it just edit post or is it edit meta or…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s quite an interesting discussion because, all of a sudden, you get a bigger picture of what all needs to be happening to make this a good feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. And it feels like, if you&#8217;re trying to match what Carl was doing, the classic editor, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t really work. So, you have to rethink it in the context of the site editor these days. What do the users today need now, not what was implemented 10 years ago?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haac</em>k: Right, totally. And the other good news is, about the block bindings UI, it&#8217;s coming out of experiments. So, if you install the Gutenberg plugin, you will be able to see it right away. You don&#8217;t have to enable an experiment for that now and can interact and try it out and test it before it comes into 6.7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It gives you a way to see all the block bindings for a block or for a section, and which fields are attributed. What it does not do yet is register the custom fields. You still need a developer to do that. That is not yet in the editor, and that&#8217;s the missing piece where I say, okay, block binding is all nice, but I still need to have a different plugin to register my custom post types&#8230; Yeah, custom post types, and with that, also the custom fields, but it&#8217;s one step at a time. Yeah. That&#8217;s the&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Rome wasn&#8217;t built in one day either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So there was something in the site editor that has been removed now. That&#8217;s the shuffle button from the block toolbar that we want…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> That button was added&#8230; Well, I might be wrong here. I think we want the shuffle button to be available mainly when we are on Zoom Out mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Because you don&#8217;t want the users to be shuffling by mistake a block, a pattern that they have already changed because they&#8217;re just editing their site. But when they&#8217;re still composing the template, they still have not decided if the pattern that they have inserted is the one that they want. We still want them to have the ability to shuffle through other patterns in the same category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s a quick browse through the patterns that we have per category. So, now it&#8217;s also to be limited to a category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, you want to see which one of the call to action patterns are fitting nicely to that, so you don&#8217;t have to click and edit. You can just shuffle it and see how it flows. But yeah, it&#8217;s interesting how a confusion can happen when you&#8217;re actually editing, editing things. So, yeah, and that&#8217;s something to learn only from usage here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next one is&#8230; It&#8217;s a tiny change, however, you probably are going to look for it when you want to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; extend your media from the cover block. It moved from the inspector controls or from the sidebar to the block toolbar into the block setting and in the&#8230; Yeah, so, you can do it from the block toolbar. You can clear the media and you don&#8217;t have to open up the sidebar and go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But if you are accustomed to having it in a sidebar and clicking there, you can now say, &#8220;Where is it?&#8221; It&#8217;s in the toolbar. Yeah, sometimes, those changes kind of can frustrate-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> It&#8217;s aligning it with other blocks, like the site logo, the feature image. They have it on the same place where it now is for the code blocks. So, now, it&#8217;s more consistent with all the blocks that behave the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah, good point. Yeah. And we love consistency, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Yes. Yeah, because with having so many contributors, it&#8217;s very easy to not think about those tiny things. So, it&#8217;s really nice when someone picks one up and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, this doesn&#8217;t feel right,&#8221; and then you notice that it&#8217;s inconsistent with other blocks and then you just bring them all in line. It&#8217;s very satisfying, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, yeah. And it actually removes confusion, and I think it&#8217;s a good time to do that now in that place where the editor is, to go through the design. And I know that we&#8217;re going to talk about it in our, later on after we get through the change here, about the design system and what&#8217;s going to happen there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the next one, maybe you can help me out with that. The content only is&#8230; So, it says, &#8220;Content only, add support for block styles on top level content only lock blocks.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. I think&#8230; I&#8217;m not so sure about the top level part. I think it means, when you have a pattern that is content-only and it has a group lock that is surrounding it, sometimes you will have block style variations that affect a group on whatever is inside. So, we&#8217;re enabling those style variations in content only. So, you can still change the styles in Cascade because the block styles in your JSON file will affect the group log and whatever&#8217;s inside. I want my group block to this background, but I want all the paragraphs inside this group block to have this other color. And you will not be able on content only to change the color of the paragraph, but because you will be able to change the block style, that Cascade still works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, okay. Yeah. Now I get it. Yeah. Excellent. Yeah, that&#8217;s a very good feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Wonderful. And then, we have two things that are already also on the Zoom Out mode. There&#8217;s an edit button on the Zoom Out mode toolbar, meaning that you can switch to an edit. Zoom Out means you&#8217;re just looking, yeah, but then, you also want&#8230; If you see something and then you want to edit it, then you need the edit button. Yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And that&#8217;s how…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I think both of those PRs are adding two different ways to exit Zoom Out mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Because we&#8217;re still thinking about how you enter it and how you leave it. So, that&#8217;s it. If you feel like you want more granular control over the blocks inside the sections, like we were talking about, content only is very similar, then you would want to be able to exit. So, these are two ways, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And the second one is, you double click on a block and then you exit Zoom Out mode and hopefully that block is then selected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And so, that&#8217;s a good thing. And then, so, the Zoom Out mode is definitely something to explore quite a bit because it changes how you might think about site building and the order of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the next two items are part of the design tool block border, block support everywhere. Now, comment edit link and the comment reply link also get border support. So we have it everywhere now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> There might still be a few missing. I&#8217;m going to take a look for 6.7 on all the design tools because I have&#8230; For 6.6, I did the roster of the design tools and there were some empty spaces in there. Now, I&#8217;m going to fill up those empty spaces on the border controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The next one is the post publish upload media dialogue is now also handling the upload errors. So, the post publish upload media dialogue, that&#8217;s the dialogue that comes when you hit publish once, and then you get a suggestion that you have images that are referencing a third outside your site. So, might be Google or might be a different website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> It could also be the theme. It could also be the theme, because the theme adds&#8230; On the templates, it adds the URL and it points to your asset folder on the themes, but the images are not on your uploads folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: And that&#8217;s the difference. So, those are lost if you change themes, but if you click that button, those get moved into your uploads folder. So, it&#8217;s in your media and your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, I didn&#8217;t know about that, but that&#8217;s cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yeah. I think that&#8217;s the reason why this is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, actually, I had early on with Ella, a dialogue that images coming from Google should automatically be uploaded. Yeah, yeah, and there were no block themes around when we had that discussion, so that was, what, five years ago?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, yeah. For sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. And it started out with a button on the toolbar of the image block where you can say upload image to media library. But then, it was also…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; &#8220;Okay, if I had 15 in my post, yeah, I don&#8217;t want to do it one at a time. Give me a feature where I can do 10 at a time.&#8221; And that was in the publishing section where it says, &#8220;Hold, you have images that are pointing someplace else,&#8221; but you were able to click on them, but the errors wouldn&#8217;t bubble up. Yeah, so, and that has now been solved with this one. So, now you get the error messages when it doesn&#8217;t work. Before it just didn&#8217;t do anything. Yeah? You were clicking and clicking and you didn&#8217;t know why it wouldn&#8217;t work. So, the typography changes comment is that, now, you can individually override the presets through the interface, I would think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> No, I think it&#8217;s theme JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, it was theme JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, I think it is. There&#8217;s an example on the PR. You click, &#8220;Here is some test.&#8221; Theme JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> There is a little arrow and you see how you can set fluid to through on a specific-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> &#8230; for the whole site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Per the preset for fluid. Yes. Yeah. So, you can have a preset one that is fluid and the other one is not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> The global setting can be set to false, and that can be overridden by one specific concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, okay. Well, thank you for making that clear. And the next one is, there is now an experiment for client-side media processing in Gutenberg. That is by Pascal Birchler. He actually has his own plugin where he experiments with all kinds of different media processing, and this one is coming as an experiment to Gutenberg. So, I&#8217;m really looking forward to that. It&#8217;s for client side media processing, so you don&#8217;t need the server involved in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s all in a browser. It&#8217;s all in the browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It&#8217;s all in the browser. And then, the last one from the enhancements is the details block gets now a transform from any block type. From a paragraph, you can make a details block. You can&#8230; From a list block, you can make a details block. And so, it&#8217;s really cool. It&#8217;s a small quality of life change that changes a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New API<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, we come to the extensibility section and there is a new API for the preview options. So, there is, on the right-hand side, on the top, you have the preview and to do either mobile or desktop or preview in a new tab. That&#8217;s what’s there, and I think now, with this release or with this Gutenberg release or the one prior, there&#8217;s also the 50% one that is your zoomed out one, right, for the desktop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> That might go away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, it might go away. It&#8217;s a zoomed out, might go away thing. Yeah. But, right now, it&#8217;s they have with the menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> No, I mean, it might go away because it will be moved somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Not because it will go away fully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It won&#8217;t totally go away, but…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; it might be its own button. Yeah. But what this PR enables is that plugin developers can have separate preview options and register them with the Gutenberg so people can look at things in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So, one of the examples is that if you build your new newsletter with the block editor, you don&#8217;t want the preview to look how it&#8217;s on the website, but you want to how to look in an email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: That&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; that&#8217;s where this example is for. But there are other examples that I right now can&#8217;t come up with, but because that&#8217;s my lack of imagination right now. But if I think about it some more, I&#8217;ll find some that were&#8230; If you have an idea, what else could be in the preview?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I don&#8217;t know, maybe you could do a preview of dark mode, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent. Yeah. Or a preview of the screen for your TV because it&#8217;s a special site…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; that it&#8217;s only for the TV, but you want to see it because it&#8217;s a whole different…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Or a tablet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; aspect ratio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. Maybe you want the landscape tablet from your preview…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>&#8230; because your website is going to be used by&#8230; Yeah, it could be anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So, I think we have a little conversation here. We come up with a lot of examples, and plugin developers, these are your opportunities. I&#8217;m going through the other 100 ones, red line items, and I stopped by CSS and styling. And these are the two PRs that made it into 6.6.2 as bug fixes. One was the featured image block, getting the CSS specificity reduced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And now is behaving nicely again with the sites. And then, the other one was the retain same specificity for non iFrame selectors. That was the piece that, if the editor wasn&#8217;t loaded into the iFrame…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Oh, I see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; some of the theme JSON things, spacing rules were overwritten by the editor. So, you wouldn&#8217;t have the same look from the editor like you have on the front page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The front page wasn&#8217;t affected by that, but it was just the editor thing. Yeah. We are also accustomed that the front page looks like the editor or the editor looks like the front page, that we notice those changes and are, &#8220;Do we have to fix something?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah. I must say that the work that&#8217;s been done with the CSS specificity has been amazing. I think it&#8217;s a really, really hard change that landed on 6.6 that, of course, add some consequences that are now being patched, but it&#8217;s still, I see the work being done to not break people&#8217;s sites and fix them when, inevitably, sometimes we do. And it&#8217;s a very big change that it&#8217;s very useful and the people really need it, but it&#8217;s still complicated and complex and they&#8217;ve been painstakingly making sure we&#8217;re not really breaking people&#8217;s site, even if it&#8217;s just by patching 6.6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, the unification of CSS specificity was very important to make the style variations work, the extended block style variations, and to have a standard way of doing things. Yeah, well…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; what you said before, yeah, there were so many contributors and now, eight years of development, some people have different CSS or early blocks had a different CSS behavior than later blocks and, yeah, everybody learned from things and now we&#8217;re back and fixing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, and that&#8217;s more consistent for themers. They know what to expect from core blocks. Other CSS is going to behave. They know that it&#8217;s going to be consistent. So, yeah, in the long run, it&#8217;s going to be great, even though now it&#8217;s a little bit of a bumpy road. But yeah, keep reporting the bugs so we can fix them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, definitely. So, on that, we are pretty much almost through the changelog for the 19.2. One thing is that, if you are a plugin developer or developer who wants to explore the DataViews component, the documentation has been updated quite a bit and edit stories for combined fields and layout properties, and that also, you can explore all that for the data use component that is in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, anything else that you&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> No, I think we covered a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development or Discussed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, we covered a lot. Yeah, yeah. But we are now arrived at the section, what&#8217;s in active development or what&#8217;s discussed? And I wanted to point out to a design blog post, not that because it was mine, but because it was very important to have it and a DataViews series on the design blog about what are the features that coming that the design team is working on? And there&#8217;s just an update number one, and there will be many, many to come on the Design Team Blog. That&#8217;s make.wordpress.org/design. More and more posts will come out and it also is an iteration of the design shares, and Joen Asmussen does every two weeks putting the whole work of the design team on display and what are they working on with the GitHub or track tickets where the discussion is happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Design Systems<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And, speaking of Joen, he just published a very visionary post about advancing the WordPress design system, and that covers that with all the new development, and in the editor, there&#8217;s also coming&#8230; What they also built is actually a design system with the components that can be used by plugin developers as well as the site editor or Gutenberg, as well as outside of the WordPress system. So, it&#8217;s the design system out of the atomic blocks building coming from components and then sub-components and building larger components. And then, you can build the interfaces from that. And everything is also done in the Figma repository that is open and public for WordPress. And then, the Storybook that we mentioned before. So, these are the three pillars of the WordPress design system. And, if you haven&#8217;t noticed that, reading that particular article will help and bring it all together and contributors will work on it, but this is where the framework of the design system to bring it all together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step is actually what we talked about as well is to focus on the specific updates on the Figma libraries and the Storybook site to set clear and actionable goals for the design system and also go through the current system and look for inconsistencies so they can be fixed. And then, also to elevate and connect the three pieces to a unified system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be bi-weekly updates on the progress in Figma. You can have your comments on the draft. And, of course, in GitHub that&#8217;s a known place where you can leave your comments and your work if you wanted to. So, a good example of a Storybook design system references the design system from the auto manufacturer, Audi, how they deal with that for the website development. What&#8217;s your thoughts about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, I just love these kinds of posts. I love all the design work on it. I love the attention to detail. I love the consistency of that. I think it&#8217;s fantastic. If you go into the Figma file that Joen links, you see that attention to detail. You see all of those components. That&#8217;s how we keep everything consistent, when you&#8217;re implementing something new and you&#8217;re using a component and something like, this is not looking good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we were seeing on the PR that we talked about where we&#8217;re adding the extensibility on the preview dropdown. If you&#8217;re looking at that PR, there&#8217;s comments saying, &#8220;Oh, it looks like, when you&#8217;re adding a new item, there&#8217;s a left padding or left margin that it&#8217;s in misalign with the rest of the things.&#8221; And you start picking those up and seeing, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s this back here.&#8221; And again, you go back and keep things consistent. So, it becomes easier and easier for new developers to come use a component and just basically use them out of the box and everything looks exactly right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> I think that&#8217;s pretty important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It also speeds up development because there are…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; certain discussions or decisions that were already made and you just need to pick them up and move with your idea forward, but you don&#8217;t have to build any&#8230; I mean, you still have to use them and know how to use them, but you don&#8217;t have to think about interfaces anymore, you&#8217;re just going to need to know-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, or accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Or accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>That&#8217;s already thought of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Exactly, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> There&#8217;s so much work in these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: That&#8217;s actually a…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maggie Cabrera: There is so much discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>It&#8217;s a big point of this as well. It&#8217;s kind of that. So, we have the three pillars, that&#8217;s the components, the Figma library, and the Storybook, but it&#8217;s also design, development, and accessibility that brings it all together. There are a few words in that article that I think I don&#8217;t understand. I need to talk with Joen about it, but when he uses the word &#8220;Pattern,&#8221; I don&#8217;t think he thinks WordPress patterns. It&#8217;s more design patterns. That&#8217;s a different pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, and he talks about design tokens. I don&#8217;t know exactly what that means. Yeah, so, it&#8217;s a little bit heavy on the technical terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah, the design lingo. Yeah, I cannot help you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>You&#8217;re a developer, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera</em>: Yeah. No, it&#8217;s not just that. I really enjoy working closely with design on designers. I think it&#8217;s one of my favorite things. I think there&#8217;s also a bit of the foreign language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maggie Cabrera: I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s for you, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>I think there&#8217;s a little bit of that because when language gets a little bit more, I don&#8217;t know, more technical or more specific…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> &#8230; if you&#8217;re not fully into that, we&#8217;re used to it as in the developer lingo, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Because we do know what the difference is between, I don&#8217;t know, yeah. But, for designers, it&#8217;s even harder, and if you are not speaking the language, then it&#8217;s an extra…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> An extra hard skill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> It has some things in there, like, what is a sticker sheet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think we can clear that all up by asking, commenting on the post and figure that out. Yeah. So&#8230; But it&#8217;s a very interesting post. I learned a lot from it, and it also seems to have quite a few comments there that are worth reading. So, I will share a link to it in the show notes and also the link to the DataViews update that just has a visual representation of a new feature that comes to the DataViews. So, it&#8217;s all in one place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, that was it. So, Maggie, if somebody wanted to get a hold of you, where would that be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Maggie Cabrera: </em>Yeah, I&#8217;m on Slack. My Slack, I&#8217;m&#8230; Let me check, because I&#8217;m not sure what my username is. I think I&#8217;m OneMaggie.

It&#8217;s such a brave new world. I had excellent results in making some of my work easier by using an AI tool:  a draft outline of a presentation in a second language (<a href=\"https://claude.ai/\">Claude</a>) , getting a tailored list of sightseeing activities in a new city (<a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\">Perplexity</a>) , or  correcting code examples to WordPress Coding Standards (<a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">ChatGPT</a>), are only three examples of well executed AI assistance. I also took a glimpse at <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/aistudio\">Google&#8217;s AI Studio</a>, that allows you to build apps or integrations that tap into Google Gemini AI. All very fascinating, I found. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My latest go-to AI tool replaces Google search for me. Google gives me short snippets and the links, I still have to weed through and spend some time finding the right information.  <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\">Perplexity</a> provides the answer with details and sources. No further trip around the Internet necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is your day-to-day experience with AI? What did you test lately?  Please let me know in the comments or hit reply on the email. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now back to regular programming&#8230;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have a lovely weekend, and if you are traveling to Portland, Oregon, have a safe trip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours, 💕<br /><em>Birgit</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#0-word-press-release-information\">Developing Gutenberg and WordPress</a><ol><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#upcoming-events\">Upcoming Events</a></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#wordpress-6-6-2\">WordPress 6.6.2</a></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#gutenberg-19-2\">Gutenberg 19.2 </a></li></ol></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#wordcamp-us-showcase-talks\">WordCamp US Showcase talks</a></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#0-p\">Plugins, Themes, and Tools for #nocode site builders and owners</a></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#2-word-press-6-0-1-and-6-1-scheduled\">Theme Development for Full Site Editing and Blocks</a></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#3-building-themes-for-fse-and-word-press\">Building Blocks and tools for the Block Editor</a></li><li><a class=\"wp-block-table-of-contents__entry\" href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wcus-gutenberg-19-2-plugin-data-playground-guides-weekend-edition-304/#wordpress-playground\">WordPress Playground</a></li></ol>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"0-word-press-release-information\">Developing Gutenberg and WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/state-of-the-word/\"><strong>State of the Word</strong></a> will take place on December 16, 2024, at 09:00 UTC and will be live-streamed from Tokyo, Japan.

In his post for GoDaddy Pro, <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/resources/skills/a-primer-on-wordpress-block-markup-for-the-non-programmer\"><strong>A primer on WordPress block markup for the non-programmer</strong></a>, he wrote: &#8220;Understanding the fundamentals of any WordPress block is not as difficult as mastering PHP as you would have back in the pre-Gutenberg era.&#8221; Following along you&#8217;ll learn about the various concepts of the modern WordPress theme, template and patterns, and of course, blocks. Then he continues to give you a glimpse under the hood and shows you some block markup code and teaches you what attributes are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels similar to when my dad showed me how to exchange spark plugs on my car or start my car with a jumper cables or replace a tire. I never aimed to be a car mechanic, but having a bit of knowledge can save you when you get stranded in a foreign place with no cell phone reception.

It&#8217;s software, it just sits there.&#8221; But if that software hadn&#8217;t been just sitting there, a group of people in Ukraine wouldn&#8217;t have been able to make <a href=\"https://crocoblock.com/\">this company</a>, to become friends and co-workers, and support each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/402979673479549\">WordCamp Crazy</a></em> is a group of men from Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh that travel together to WordCamps around the world. If that doesn&#8217;t seem odd to you then you don&#8217;t know the history of those three countries.  On the whole they don&#8217;t get along. Yet because WordPress exists these men met on common ground and became friends. Sure it&#8217;s just a small group of people, but it&#8217;s one step in healing the wounds between their countries.

Not just core, not just plugins, themes, hacks, tweaks and code.

This latest release includes notable changes such as Block Bindings UI, enhancements to the Zoom Out mode, an experimental client-side media processing feature, and some bug fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a rundown of the key features and changes:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Block Bindings UI Moving Out of the Experimental Phase</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most significant updates in Gutenberg 19.2 is removing the experimental flag from the Block Bindings UI. This feature, now fully integrated into the editor, allows users to link block attributes with external data sources seamlessly. By default, only admin users can create and modify bindings, ensuring greater control and security.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vicente Canales from the Core team has shared this video in the announcement post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Preview Options Extensibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new release also adds extensibility to Preview Options via the Plugin API.Plugin and theme developers can now introduce custom preview options in the block editor’s preview dropdown. This allows users to preview content in different formats or environments, offering more flexibility in how they view their creations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhanced Zoom Out Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The toolbar now has an “Edit” button, making it easier to switch between modes. Users can also exit Zoom Out mode by double-clicking on blocks and the “Shuffle” block toolbar button has been removed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Content-Only Mode Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In Content-Only mode, top-level locked blocks now support block styles, providing more consistent designs. Block icons are also now displayed in the toolbar for easier identification.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experimental Client-side Media Processing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 19.2 introduces an experimental client-side media processing feature. This reduces the server load and potentially improves performance and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable highlights include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A new reorder control is available at the field level on the new view configuration UI.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The minimum supported WordPress version for Create Block is now set to 6.6.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Only admin users are allowed to create and modify block bindings by default.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Block editor improvements include a ‘Reset’ option for the MediaReplaceFlow component and Block Library enhancements include better handling of social icons and pagination blocks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>10 bug fixes, including a fix for pagination arrows pointing the wrong way in RTL languages and resolving an editor error in Safari caused by the checkVisibility method.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There has been one <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/gutenberg-version-19-2-brokes-the-editor/\">reported issue</a> with this release, where it causes problems with the Web Stories editor. WordPress Core Committer Pascal Birchler has confirmed that the issue is related to Gutenberg and not Web Stories.

Welcome back to another episode of <em>Scaling Enterprise WordPress: The Inside Track</em>. I am one half of your co-hosting duo, back for another really fun episode. We have a really awesome guest, which we&#8217;ll get to in just a second, but as always, I want to welcome Tom, the other half of this show, to the episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Hey, Brad. Hey, great to be here. Excited to be doing another episode. For those that listened to Karim&#8217;s last episode, unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t be on that one as I was on vacation up a mountain with very poor internet, so glad to be back home on the fiber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah. Well, we&#8217;re happy to have you back, and this is going to be a really fun episode, so I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here because we have a really special guest whom we&#8217;d like to introduce now. James Giroux is joining us on the show. Hey, James.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Hello. Hello, everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Very excited. If anyone who&#8217;s been in the WordPress industry for a while has probably crossed paths with James at some event or some online endeavor. James, you have a really cool kind of history of your path through WordPress, and one of the reasons I want to set the context of why you&#8217;re on the show about enterprise, I think that&#8217;s important, but then we&#8217;ll dive quickly into how you got there because I think it&#8217;s a really fun journey, and I want to hear a little bit more about it. What really caught my eye, James, was back in July you posted a tweet and a blog post announcing that you started a new role at WordPress VIP under Automattic, and you&#8217;re learning enterprise deeply. So right away that caught my eye because I had never quite heard that phrase, &#8220;learning enterprise deeply,&#8221; but I was like, we got to get James on the show because he is literally doing what we&#8217;re talking about within WordPress and the inside track around enterprise. You have a really great blog post about it, which we&#8217;ll talk about and we&#8217;ll share in the show notes, but I&#8217;d love to hear a little bit about your journey through WordPress, kind of quickly how you got to where you are now. You&#8217;ve touched so many different parts of the WordPress ecosystem that brought you to VIP and the enterprise level side of it. So, let&#8217;s talk about how you got there real quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Sure, yeah. I have been in the WordPress ecosystem for, oh, 15-plus years at this point, so it&#8217;s been a long time. Not maybe as long as the two of you, but I&#8217;m chasing your heels a little bit. Like most folks, I got started just looking for something that I could use to build a website. So, that&#8217;s kind of how I got started tinkering, and from there I like to call it the &#8220;four bases of WordPress.&#8221; You&#8217;ve got Marketplace, Agency, Product, and Automattic. Those are the four bases as far as I&#8217;m concerned in WordPress. My journey is like that. That&#8217;s why I called it a home run, but I started out really just on the freelance side, on the agency side, doing work for customers, clients, all that kind of thing. Then from there, I ended up working with a product called PageLines, which was one of the early pioneers of this whole page builder concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />I remember PageLines. Yeah, that was a long time ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />A very long time ago. So I worked there developing themes and plugins for that ecosystem, and that&#8217;s really what kind of launched me into WordPress at a community level, was my involvement there. I was hired by PageLines eventually as their Director of Operations, working with developers and things like that. From there, I met some folks from Envato at PressNomics. I was at PressNomics 3, hanging out, driving around, and ended up hearing about a role at Envato. So, I joined Envato in 2016 as their WordPress evangelist, which was great. I could continue to go to all the events that I really wanted to go to and get paid for it, which was a really neat and novel thing at the time. After about five years there, I moved to Gravity Forms and worked at one of these pillar product companies in the WordPress ecosystem. Then I was at StellarWP, working with all the folks over there. I was a Director of Brand and Product Marketing there, then transitioned out of that, and now I am at Automattic in WordPress VIP as a Technical Account Manager. Bit of a career swap, but I&#8217;m loving it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Very cool. Yeah, no, I think one thing that stands out about your story is just, and I like to talk about the community and the impact of engaging, meeting people, and going to events. I know things are a little different than they were maybe 10 or 15 years ago, but there&#8217;s still a lot of value in those events. Like you said, your career path was just by attending and being present, meeting people, and talking to people. It shaped your career and kind of opened some doors that maybe otherwise would&#8217;ve been harder to open, going in without any kind of a warm lead or knowing people within that company or within that industry. So, just want to touch on that, get out there because it can absolutely help in the growth of your career and what your goals are and your aspirations, which is another reason why I love this community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, going into really focusing on where you&#8217;re at now and some of the goals that you&#8217;re looking to accomplish, going back to that &#8220;learning enterprise deeply.&#8221; You posted this a few months ago, so I have to imagine you have not learned everything about enterprise in a couple of months. I think you probably have a little bit further to go, but I&#8217;d love to hear a little bit about early on—it&#8217;s been about a month and a half since your post and you&#8217;ve kind of dug into this a bit—but what are some of the things that really stand out? Maybe some of the challenges, or things that were unexpected or maybe even expected, but what really stood out just in the last month and a half, two months since you&#8217;ve been in this new role?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly! Here&#8217;s the continuation of the transcript with corrected spelling and punctuation:</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />I think one of the things about enterprise that folks on the outside maybe don&#8217;t understand is you really don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know. I think that for me has been the first little bit of learning here—it&#8217;s learning what I don&#8217;t know. I didn’t really know what a DXP was before joining WordPress VIP—that’s a Digital Experience Platform, for those who don’t know. I didn’t really understand the role that WordPress played in larger enterprise infrastructure and how it integrates, and the kinds of complexities at a technical level that a lot of enterprises deal with. Nor would I, because so much of my past experience has been very direct WordPress, where you have one application, you have one WordPress installation that you’re responsible for, and you have to be concerned about that at a very small scale. In terms of traffic, all the concerns are very different, and looking at how do I scale that thinking out and look at the kinds of challenges that exist. So, that’s been really interesting. The sales cycle has been interesting. The role of technology service providers, or technology platforms like VIP, and the relationship they have with agencies, and how those work together. The role they play, and the relationships they need to develop with product companies as well, and how that factors into how we deliver solutions to customers and clients. It’s a very interesting nut to crack, and I’m enjoying it. Yeah, it’s so much to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />We could probably do an entire show on sales cycles, couldn’t we, Tom? I mean that’s, oh boy. That might be a little bit of a trigger for both of us as agency owners in this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, we’re both jealous of you not knowing about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah. It’s interesting you mentioned not knowing what you don’t know, and I think when the larger community hears &#8220;enterprise&#8221; and &#8220;WordPress&#8221; specifically, I think the assumption is it’s a big website with a lot of content, a lot of writers, most likely a lot of users in the backend, and a lot of traffic, which is by and large pretty true, but there’s a lot more than that. That’s kind of the surface level of what enterprise entails. All the behind-the-scenes stuff of integrating with SSO and different providers and APIs, and all the security requirements that go into it that are well outside of Core WordPress. It can absolutely work with WordPress, but it takes more advanced teams to make those things happen. So when you really get under the hood of what the enterprise work is with WordPress, it’s so much more than just big websites with a lot of traffic—a way I like to describe it. But there’s a lot more than that when you start peeling back that onion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Absolutely. It’s been really interesting looking at the number of people that need to be involved, and you can’t really get away from it. You think, &#8220;Oh, it’s just a big website with more traffic.&#8221; But no, I mean it’s bigger projects, there are more stakeholders, there are more moving parts that you may or may not understand or know about. There’s a lot of extra discovery that goes into it. It’s been really interesting watching different projects that we’ve gotten different customers on. So, we’ve got customers that are just starting and getting ready to launch and going through that process of migrating from maybe an existing build they have on a different platform or on a different WordPress installation over onto the VIP architecture. And then you’ve got those that have been on VIP architecture for a while and sort of what maintenance looks like in that cycle and how that goes forward. It’s really, really interesting. And just the number of people involved at all different levels and the ongoing work and the constant communication that needs to happen at an enterprise level is way different from running a local restaurant or running a local e-commerce retail shop&#8217;s website. It’s very, very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, no doubt. Tom, what do you got over there? I don’t want to monopolize this conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Well, I’m keen to dive a little bit into some of the stuff that you raised in the blog post that you wrote calling on the WordPress ecosystem to embrace enterprise. So, why’d you write it? I guess this phrase “learn enterprise deeply”—we’ve typically reserved that phrase for pretty important things. I think Matt’s only used it twice, for JavaScript and then for AI. So, why do you think enterprise is that important to the WordPress ecosystem?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Well, as a community, as a content management system platform and open source, we’ve done a really good job of hitting the ones and twos, right? We are really good at being a first choice for a lot of folks that are looking for a website that delivers minimal traffic concerns, no compliance, no security—none of that kind of stuff. But if we want to grow the ecosystem beyond the ones and twos to the hundreds and the thousands, we really need to look at where a lot of folks work. They work in government, they work in large enterprise, they’re on marketing teams of thousands rather than marketing teams of five. There are intranets and extranets and all of that kind of stuff where WordPress has an opportunity to flex its muscles. And we have maybe not fully understood that or cared so much about it. Like all folks, we take the path of least resistance. We go for what’s easiest first. We’ve done easy. We’ve accomplished easy. And now it’s time to accomplish what’s maybe a little bit harder. My whole pitch, my whole thinking behind that is, if we want to see WordPress grow to 80% market share—which I know is probably a pipe dream—but if we want to double what we’re currently at, 43%, and get to 86%, then we need to get into these enterprises because that’s where young people are going to work as well. They’re not all going into startups, they’re not all building apps for themselves and doing things for themselves. They need to find a job, and they’re getting jobs in banks and pharmaceutical companies and all these other places. If the tooling that they’re being provided is Sitecore or Adobe, whatever Adobe is running with, they’re not getting the best of what the web can be. And so, that for me is one of the reasons, because once they’re experienced with WordPress in work—when they’re paid to use WordPress in their day-to-day—that’s going to leak out into their side projects because that’s the platform they’re most familiar with. That’s how we grow adoption. That’s how we grow WordPress in my opinion, and actually get it to a place where it’s solving the really hard problems of the web that folks have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />That’s a super interesting take, because it’s like actually probably a lot of the early growth of WordPress was almost the opposite of that, right? People were not using it at work, but they were discovering it and using it for their own stuff. They were blogging, they were using it for their kids’ football team or whatever, and a lot of the early penetration into business was people using it for their side projects and then bringing it with them, fighting the good fight internally: &#8220;Why don’t we use this WordPress thing for our site? I’ve been using it, it’s great.&#8221; Maybe we’re transitioning out of that, and actually it needs to become the default at work so that all these young people who get jobs are introduced to it there. I love that take. I’ve never really quite thought of it in those terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />I think even early on, as WordPress really started transforming from a blogging platform to a true CMS, back when custom post types were introduced and it really became an option for the enterprise, getting some of those early enterprise clients also really helped validate it for everybody. I know it made my job easier as an agency owner when I said, &#8220;Hey, we just launched something on microsoft.com with WordPress.&#8221; So, everybody we talked to at that point, the idea of “Is it secure? Can we use it?”—those questions really went out the window once we said, &#8220;Well, Microsoft’s using it, and they did a full-blown security audit on it.&#8221; So that in some way also helped, I think probably more in that mid-market, to say, &#8220;Hey, we can actually use this when we just thought it was a blogging platform.&#8221; So, I think even that early on, just getting a couple of those key large enterprise brands on WordPress, and we could all point to them as a community and say, &#8220;Look what these brands are doing,&#8221; that really helped accelerate WordPress into the CMS market and has continued to, because I still use those examples. But we don’t have to answer those questions anymore, or certainly not as often. &#8220;Is it secure? Is it a blogging platform?&#8221;—those are long gone, right? The enterprise has helped squash that, in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, I completely agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I’m interested in enterprise WordPress’s place within the wider ecosystem, the awareness of it, the role it plays—maybe what your perspective was on that or your awareness of it before, and how that’s shifted since. And maybe, therefore, what you think we need to do more as an enterprise WordPress community, as the subset of the WordPress community that’s focused on enterprise, to better showcase actually how successful WordPress is in enterprise. You were saying you joined VIP, and you get exposed to quite a lot of stuff, and you’re like, &#8220;Oh, I perhaps didn’t actually know WordPress was being used</p>\n\n\n\n<p>in these ways or the level of complexity.&#8221; It’s a bit of an iceberg problem I think we have, where there’s quite a lot more happening than perhaps people realize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />I think there are a couple things to that. Before I really dove deep into enterprise, I couldn’t find anything on WordPress enterprise. There was nothing out there I could read, there’s nothing out there I could go to. I mean, I could go to events—and I did—and I’m very grateful to folks who would invite me to show up at their enterprise events. But I didn’t know how to even jump into those conversations or start them, and that’s a big part of it. I couldn’t go to a WordCamp and get a 101 talk on enterprise. We joke about the sales cycle, but it’s so intimidating. But where’s the opportunity for agencies that are looking to build out their freelancer bench to talk about what does it actually take to become an enterprise freelancer or to work in this space? Or how can we equip you to be able to jump into what we need? There’s none of that. And so, I think that’s one of the reasons why I wrote that blog post—to sort of wave a bit of that flag and say, &#8220;Hey, I can’t even find anything to help me get started on the path toward enterprise.&#8221; And the reality is that what’s going to end up happening is folks that are really good at Drupal—not that that’s bad—but that’s sort of where enterprise is, or they’re really good at Sitecore, and they’re going to go, &#8220;Okay, well, we’ll expand our toolset, maybe we’ll look at WordPress,&#8221; but they’re not really going to be from the community. They’re not going to be part of the story of what we’ve been, and it’s going to make it harder for those of us who truly understand what WordPress is all about to get in front of these enterprises that are looking, possibly, at WordPress as a tool, and helping them understand what this ecosystem and this community is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that’s one thing. I think, what can enterprise folks be doing? You need to get out there more. This is hard because I’ve been here a couple months now, and I haven’t written a blog post since my announcement post because my brain is so packed with all of the things that I’m trying to learn and understand, the complexities, and just all the things that I’m finding it hard to sit down and write. What do I write about? What do I talk about now? So, I need to get out there and do that. And that’s what we need more of. We need more enterprise champions showing up at WordPress events, at WordCamps, doing things like this podcast—which I think is fantastic—and just really talking through what does it mean to be enterprise WordPress? What are the challenges we’re facing? How do we invite folks in? How do we get product folks in who maybe have no idea how their product is being used in an enterprise setting? I’ve got a call coming up with one product company that has no enterprise pricing, no enterprise service level, but their product is being used in a really intense way on a customer’s website. What’s really cool is being able to facilitate that as somebody who’s got both the community side and the enterprise side now, but we need more of those relationships to develop between WordPress product companies and enterprise agencies and enterprise infrastructure companies—I would call VIP. Let’s get them all around the same table and talking. The product companies don’t have any clue how their products are being used at scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I mean that’s definitely a common problem I see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, and thank you for calling out the podcast because honestly, one of the reasons we’re doing this is because there aren’t enough people in the WordPress ecosystem, WordPress space, talking about enterprise and sharing our knowledge and information. Getting people like you, James, on to share your experiences, your learning, and where you’re at, because there just hasn’t really been a lot of this, even going back across the 15 years or so that we’ve all been doing this. There hasn’t really been a lot of dedication around enterprise, talking about it, challenges, what can we do to help push it? It’s another reason why we’re all really excited, and Tom and I are both a part of the Scale Consortium, which for years I think many of us kind of looked at Automattic, and maybe even VIP in a sense, and said, &#8220;Help us, sell us in the enterprise. Help push us into the enterprise.&#8221; But the reality is it was on all of us to do that. So, it took a little bit of time, but finally all the agencies were able to get together that work in that space, in the WordPress enterprise space, and say, &#8220;Look, if we work together on helping spread positive information and what people are doing in WordPress enterprise, it’s going to help all of us.&#8221; And so now the Scale Consortium exists exactly for that reason. We’re really pushing into the space to help spread awareness, spread information, help people learn around enterprise, have events at WordCamps or other webinars, share that information. Because you’re right, I think many of us agency owners especially, it’s trial by fire. Did I start WebDev thinking I want to get into enterprise? No. But when Microsoft walks through your door or a big brand walks through your door, you learn it real quick, right? Not going to tell them no. So, I love that you call that out. Exactly why we’re doing this. We’re hoping to get more of this in, between the show we’re doing here, and then with Karim and Tom. Even though we’re early, I feel like the information we’re getting out there—these are conversations that have not been happening in the public, and they need to be happening. So, I love it, and I’m hoping that the audience is also understanding what we’re trying to do here and getting some value out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I mean I hope that you do keep blogging as well, James, actually, because I’ve read your blog for a long time, long before you were writing about enterprise, so I’m kind of even more excited to read it now that you’re in enterprise, which is a space that’s even closer to my interests. The listeners to this show should all go and start reading it—that’ll add to the pressure for you to then give them some content that’s relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />I don’t know if it’s writer’s block or if it’s just my brain is full of all the things, but I’ve been challenged. I’m going to WordCamp US and I’m looking forward to the conversations. WordCamp US is really exciting for me this year because of Showcase Day, and because it’s a really good opportunity for enterprise to have its moment in the sun, so to speak, and the spotlight. We get to see innovation, we get to see scale, and it’s so exciting that somebody’s starting to pick that up a bit. I’m looking forward to the kinds of conversations it spurs. I’m curious what I’m going to be thinking about after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I think it’s going to be super interesting. I mean, I agree, it’s a really exciting evolution. I know even last year there was the NASA keynote, which was almost a precursor to this Showcase Day, and that’s a really great evolution. It’s going to be interesting—probably the first time there’s going to be a day with all of those people who are doing this kind of work, all there, showcasing together. The conversations afterward—I’m pretty interested to see what the floor traffic is like, and the kind of conversations that come off the back of that, the collaboration. Hopefully that opens up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />There’ll probably be some surprises in those showcases, too. There are going to be some things that kind of blow us all away—like, &#8220;Oh wow, look what they built, look what they did.&#8221; I mean, just WordCamp last year with NASA.gov and the big push there and the presentations was honestly digging into understanding the amount of data and what they worked through was pretty mind-blowing. And obviously, it was all behind the scenes until they presented that. So, it was just fun to hear more of the challenges, more in how they worked through those with NASA, especially with the amount of content, which was absolutely insane, that they had to migrate into a block-based system. So, it’s fun sharing that stuff, it’s fun hearing it. I’m glad it is more focused. I know Matt used to—Matt Mullenweg—used to mention some highlights in his State of the Word, but he’s kind of gotten away from that, and probably for good reason, because he doesn’t want to play favorites when you’re showing off what other companies did. That could come off as playing favorites. So, I’m excited about that, too, because I’m sure there are going to be some interesting surprises—projects none of us knew were even out there, things that happened, and we’ll be like, &#8220;Oh, wow, I’m going to be telling some of my clients about that because that’s cool.&#8221; Sharing the information around enterprise, sharing out there. I know it’s not all enterprise—it’s just showcasing WordPress—but I have a feeling there’ll be a few big showcases in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />I’m excited to see our enterprise customers and clients in the WordPress ecosystem having their time to present what WordPress means to them and how they’re using WordPress from their mouths, from their perspective, and what will it mean. The WordPress ecosystem is very different from the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>way the rest of the world operates. We’re kind of nice. And because we’re kind of nice and because we’re kind of kind to folks, the way we operate and interoperate together is a little bit different, and that can throw folks for a loop that are coming from other industries. And so, it’ll be really neat to see what happens when you get these big publishers that are competitors in the publishing landscape together, showcasing how they’re using the same technology platform to achieve their goals and do things, and what’s going to happen when they start talking to each other off the stage and see some of that WordPress culture, that WordPress community vibe sort of leak into how they interact with each other. There’s just something really cool about that that I’m looking forward to seeing happen, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />And honestly, just in WordPress in general, I feel like that is the vibe. People want to share. And maybe honestly, it’s the open-source vibe. It’s not just WordPress. It’s like if you’re into open-source and you’re into it enough that you’re going to attend an event about a piece of software, I’ve got to believe there’s some passion behind it. You’re proud and excited about what you’re doing, and you want to share it—even if you’re sharing it with competitors, you want to say, &#8220;Hey, look at the cool things we’re doing over here.&#8221; And they’re probably, like you said, sharing some things they’re doing that you weren’t aware of or you might be interested in. It’s similar to what agencies are doing and freelancers—we’re all showing off our work, like, &#8220;Look at this cool thing we built.&#8221; So, you’re right. Seeing actual owners of websites, publishers, really showing off and sharing information is going to be pretty neat. It’s just open-source. We’re all out there trying to build and help each other and just build an awesome platform that we can all use. So, I’d like to talk just a little bit about some of the goals. What are some of your longer-term goals within this new role? What kind of impact are you looking to make around organizations, clients, or just WordPress in general? We’ve talked about it being just a month and a half—it’s still a fairly new role for you—but long-term, your vision, what kind of impact are you looking to make?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Well, I’ve packed up 15 years of marketing experience and taken that hat off and put on the account management hat. It’s a bit of a career reset for me, which is kind of neat to do. Long-term…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Maybe a little scary too, huh?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, it is. It’s very scary. You’re sort of starting from ground zero again, but with 15 years of experience, it’s kind of cool actually to do that. My first goal is to become the best technical account manager in the world. So, that’s maybe the entrepreneur in me going, &#8220;Take over the world!&#8221; or whatever. But I want to be the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I like that. That’s only the first goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, that’s the first goal: be the best I can be, be the best that I can do, support my team, be somebody they can count on, bring all of the knowledge and depth of experience I have across the WordPress ecosystem into this role and add value to these relationships, and add value. That’s the number one thing. Maybe selfishly—we don’t really have a lot of—this sounds so funny to say—but enterprise WordPress influencers. Why not be an ambassador for enterprise WordPress? We need more folks that are championing the transition from one side of WordPress to the other and opening those doors, and it’s something I did all throughout my career in the rest of WordPress, so I don’t see why I couldn’t do that at the enterprise level and just connect folks to each other, connect partners. So many of our product companies just need a door to be opened for them or exposure to what’s going on in enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Yeah, I mean I’d love to do an episode actually on enterprise for WordPress product companies. Of all the parts of WordPress, I think they’re the ones that seem to have cracked enterprise the least. But like you say, there are lots of enterprise companies that are discovering their stuff and using it, and there’s a lot of opportunity there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Please start charging more for products because enterprise, they don’t want to pay $99 a year. They just won’t trust it if it’s that cheap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />But the issue isn’t the $99, it’s the fact that they’re not going to get the level of service and access to a team that they need. Every build is unique. We think that folks in enterprise are just using WordPress as vanilla WordPress—they’re not. They’re taking WordPress, and they’re molding it and shaping it into something that works for them. They’re rebranding it internally. They have different names for it as a tool, and they can do that because they’re paying millions of dollars a year to do that. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Well, yeah, there we go. Add that on the list, Brad, for a future episode because…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, I love that idea, Tom. I love that. And talk about enterprise influencers. I mean, I’ve got to be honest, Tom’s got the look, he’s got the style, he’s got the voice—just lacking the influence! The stars are aligning, Tom, I’m telling you. But I do think I love it because, like we talked about, getting more content out there—and honestly, even YouTube and videos are so popular now, more popular than ever, and it’s really gaining traction. And within the WordPress space, there’s just a lot of great video content out there, and I expect that’s only going to continue to grow, especially in the enterprise space too, as that usually catches up once the masses are out there doing it. But yeah, more content, more information, sharing resources, getting people talking about more of the challenges, talking about the FUD that’s out there from other platforms, talking about WordPress and how we kind of speak back to that and alleviate those concerns. So, enterprise is a big topic, and there is a lot to dig into, which is one of the reasons we’re doing this. We bring on awesome people like you, James, and really understand where you’re at, your experiences. And what I would love to do is have you come back on the show maybe in six months, maybe next year at some point, and really circle back through your progression. What has transpired? Did you expect it? What have you learned? Things like that. Since you are a little bit new into the role, I think it’ll be fun to have you back on a little bit later next year and kind of dig back into where we’re at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />When you’re a grizzled and tired enterprise WordPress expert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />After the honeymoon period is over and I’m into the day-to-day grind. Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, after the old honeymoon period. But it’s pretty exciting. Just to wind down a little bit, any kind of final thoughts around the enterprise space and really what’s just top of mind for you, James? We talked about short-term goals, some longer-term goals, but really what’s top of mind for you in the space and where you’re looking to go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />I think, like that blog post says, we’ve got a lot of opportunity to help people get a better grasp of what enterprise actually looks like. I think WordPress is ready. I think a lot of our product companies and even our hosting companies that are maybe more downstream are ready to make the leap. They just need some help figuring out what that looks like. I would like to see more of that happening. Maybe I’ll write about that. Actually, that’s a good topic for me to sort of follow up on. What am I thinking about? What are my final thoughts? I’m curious to see how we as CMS folks—not just as WordPress—start to navigate thought leadership more broadly. WordPress, we’re competing against Adobe, we’re competing against some other proprietary platforms. We’re going up against these monolith DXPs, and we’re advocating for composability—all words that make sense to folks that are in enterprise, but maybe don’t make sense to anybody outside of it. But we have an opportunity to lead the pack when it comes to innovation. AI, we’re so much more agile than a lot of these other platforms are, and I would love to see us moving more in that direction as well, more broadly, and bringing more folks who maybe have sold themselves to these other platforms to come over and see what it’s like. The grass is very much greener over here. So, yeah, those are the things I’m thinking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Come on over. We’re very friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I mean, that ties back perfectly into the need for more influencers, right? Because I think actually the biggest need for influencers is to project that vision that we have—that WordPress has for enterprise—out into the world. At the moment, most of the buzzwords and categories and descriptions of what enterprise CMS is are set by our competitors, set by the analysts. And we tend to play catch-up, and we tend to say, &#8220;Oh, WordPress could do that,&#8221; but they’re the ones that came up with what that is. And then we’re scrambling to try and prove WordPress could do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s exactly right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />Actually, perhaps with folks like you getting out and saying, &#8220;Well, actually, this is what WordPress’s vision for enterprise CMS is,&#8221; that’s super exciting. I think if we can start doing that—that’s a great point, Tom. That’s the next era of growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Awesome. Well, this has been a really fun show. Appreciate you coming on, James. You mentioned you’re going to be at WordCamp US coming up, which is September 17th through the 20th out in Portland, Oregon. I will be there as well. Tom, are you going to make the trek over?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />I will be there, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Yeah, you’ll be there. It’s a long flight for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />It’s a long flight for me, so I’m stopping in New York on the way, so I’m not coming as far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Okay, well, that’ll help break up the flight a little bit. But anywhere else people can find you online, James? You want to plug your blog or any social networks where people can interact with you if someone wants to chase you down and say hi?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James:<br />Yeah, absolutely. My blog, <a href=\"https://jamesgiroux.ca\">JamesGiroux.ca</a> is a great place. My handle pretty much everywhere is JamesGiroux, so you can find me on X (formerly known as Twitter), LinkedIn, or give you my Gravatar—yeah, so it’s all there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Very cool. Well, I look forward to seeing you in person there. I’m definitely going to track you down at WordCamp US and get a little FaceTime. Really appreciate you coming on the show, James, and we’re looking forward to following your progress and really rooting for you and rooting for the enterprise. And we’re here to support, however, as obviously, this is important to all of us, as well as a lot of people out there. So, I’m excited we’re doing the show. I’m excited we’re talking about it, we’re getting people like you that are talking about it, blogging about it, and right in the middle of it. So, this is exactly what we’re looking to showcase with this platform. It’s been a lot of fun. So, Tom, anything you want to plug before we head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom:<br />No, just to say thank you for the work that you’ve been doing so far, especially the blogging and the influencing. That’s, I think, a big gap. So, keep doing that. And yeah, looking forward to talking more about WordCamp US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brad:<br />Awesome. Well, for Tom, I’m Brad Williams. This is <em>Scaling Enterprise: The Inside Track</em>. We will see you on the next episode. See you, everyone.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <em><strong>Scaling Enterprise WordPress: The Inside Track</strong></em>, co-hosts <strong>Brad Williams</strong> and <strong>Tom Willmot</strong> discuss the evolving role of WordPress in the enterprise space with special guest J<strong>ames Giroux, Technical Account Manager at WordPress VIP.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>James shares insights from his 15-year journey through the WordPress ecosystem, touching on his experiences across freelancing, product development, and enterprise-level projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation covers key topics such as the challenges and opportunities of scaling WordPress for large organizations, the importance of community and networking in career development, and the future of WordPress in the enterprise market. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also highlights the need for more enterprise WordPress champions, the role of thought leadership in driving adoption, and the exciting developments to come at WordCampUS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Importance of Enterprise in WordPress Growth:</strong> James emphasizes that for WordPress to continue its growth and dominance in the CMS market, it must break into enterprise-level organizations, which house large teams and complex systems. The WordPress community has historically catered to smaller users, but scaling up is necessary for future growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learning Enterprise Deeply:</strong> James shares his experience transitioning into the enterprise space, learning about complex systems, technical challenges, and the unique needs of large-scale organizations. He introduces terms like DXP (Digital Experience Platform) and highlights how enterprise WordPress involves more than just a large website—it&#8217;s about integrating with systems, APIs, security, and compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Role of Community and Networking in Career Development:</strong> All three hosts stress the importance of attending events, engaging with the community, and making connections to advance in the WordPress ecosystem. James credits much of his career growth to attending events like WordCamp and building relationships within the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Challenges in the Enterprise Space:</strong> There are many moving parts when it comes to WordPress in the enterprise—more stakeholders, longer sales cycles, complex integrations, and technical requirements. James points out that many people in the WordPress community might not realize the depth of these challenges until they dive in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Opportunity for Product Companies</strong>: WordPress product companies often don’t realize how their tools are being used at an enterprise level. There’s a need for more collaboration between product companies and enterprise organizations to align pricing models, service levels, and support structures that suit large-scale projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Influencers in the Enterprise WordPress Space</strong>: There is a growing need for WordPress &#8220;enterprise influencers&#8221;—people who can champion WordPress as a solution for large organizations and communicate its advantages to a broader audience. By doing so, WordPress can challenge competitors like Adobe and Sitecore more effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Value of Events Like WordCamp US</strong>: Events like WordCamp US provide a platform for showcasing what WordPress can achieve at scale. Presentations like NASA’s website migration highlight WordPress’s capabilities for handling massive projects, and these showcases help promote WordPress as a serious contender in the enterprise CMS space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Long-term Goals in Enterprise WordPress</strong>: James is focused on becoming a top-tier Technical Account Manager while also serving as an ambassador for enterprise WordPress, bridging the gap between the community and large organizations.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, enhanced WordPress with AI translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice. Or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Matthias Pupillo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthias has extensive experience in the technology and creative sectors, and is currently working as the co-founder of FluentC AI, an AI powered language technology company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a background in technology, he&#8217;s focusing on developing solutions to enhance communication across different languages and platforms. He&#8217;s been involved with WordPress since its early days, around version 1.2, and has a rich history of web design and consulting, having worked on hundreds of WordPress websites. But it&#8217;s only recently that he&#8217;s become more engaged in the WordPress community through events like WordCamp Buffalo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the podcast today, we talk about AI driven language translations, particularly focusing on Matthias&#8217;s work with FluentC, which is his translation plugin for WordPress. It supports multithreaded simultaneous translations of up to 140 languages, enabling your pages and posts to be offered in other languages in just a few moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We covered the differences between AI models designed for translation, such as ChatGPT, and Llama, which aren&#8217;t specialized for this task, and how his platform builds a contextual layer above those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He emphasizes the importance of context and diverse multi-lingual data in producing high quality translations. FluentC&#8217;s functionality involves local storage of translated content in an effort to maintain website speed. This is done using native WordPress hooks, and URL modifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthias also offers his thoughts on the ongoing multi-lingual support phase of the Gutenberg project. And his hopes for FluentC to evolve from a standalone plugin to an API, which could be used by WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the broader implications of AI in translation, the need for open source models to compete in this rapidly evolving space, and the parallels between AI evolution and past trends like blockchain, and web 2.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the intersection of AI and WordPress, or looking to enhance your website&#8217;s multi-lingual capabilities, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Matthias Pupillo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Matthias Pupillo. How you doing Matthias?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:54] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> I&#8217;m doing fantastic, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Very, very nice to have you with us. We had a little bit of a chat before we pressed record, and in that chat, Matthias revealed to me that he&#8217;s got a long history with WordPress, but not necessarily the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthias, we&#8217;re going to be talking about AI, transcribing, transliteration, multilingual, all that kind of stuff today. Before we do, would you just give us a quick potted bio of your history with tech, WordPress, however far you want to go back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:19] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Oh yeah, absolutely. So I&#8217;ve been a software, I have to say commercially, building software for 25 years. I&#8217;ve been recreationally building software for 35 years. So I started pretty much when I was eight building code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I started in WordPress with 1.2. I was writing hand coded HTML in Microsoft notes, and so it was a dramatic shift back then in 2002, 2003.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was running my own consulting firm, doing web design professionally, and found WordPress by, it was a divine intervention one day. Someone wanted to pay me for editing, and I didn&#8217;t know how to write software, besides HTML, CSS and Java. And Java back then was not building a website. It was a complicated journey and it was fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day WordPress 2.5.5, when we had tabs, that was great. And then we got 2.6 and it went horizontal menu, that was a fun day. It&#8217;s been a long road with WordPress. I think I&#8217;ve built two or three hundred websites with it, maybe more. Not to mention coaching, staffing, and like guidance from an architecture standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a really long and storied, well, a really long story basically, so that&#8217;s lovely. But however, one of the things that you said a moment ago was that, although you&#8217;ve been using WordPress for a long time, the community side of it is more recent I think. Only in the fairly recent past that you&#8217;ve got yourself out to events, and started to interact with the community more. Is that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:41] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s right. Yeah, so I built the translation company FluentC, we built for apps, and GraphQL, and other integrations. And I forgot WordPress, I really did. Our website was built in WordPress, our marketing flow, our CRM, everything was in WordPress, and I forgot to build the engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, out of my shame of forgetting that, I rapidly built the plugin. Then spent four months trying to get it approved, and then joined the community in person. And my first WordCamp was in Buffalo this last May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You alluded to it earlier, but I might as well get the URL out there. So FluentC is the URL, but it&#8217;s not what you are thinking, I suspect. I imagine you are thinking it ends in a Y, but my records here show that it&#8217;s fluent, and then the letter C, so F-L-U-E-N-T-C, dot io. So, fluent, the letter C, dot io. What is this service? And we&#8217;ll come to the WordPress component in a moment. But obviously you built the SaaS version, if you like, first. What is its MVP, if you like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:39] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, so it came out of a problem that, I&#8217;ve built a lot of apps for healthcare, and it always offended me that they were only in one language. And the cost, time and effort to build a multi-language app was just always put to the back end of the priority list. And in healthcare it&#8217;s incredibly important that the patient knows what the directions are, knows what the medications are, knows what their appointments are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I built FluentC to handle that, and to build that multi-language, make it app developer friendly, our SaaS component is a no code solution, no code translation. If you want it native, are built into the app itself, use our GraphQL, and our i18next integrations. And then it was just, it just had to exist because of, patients need that native touch, and it needs to be super easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer tools are always built by people who aren&#8217;t developers, it has always been a sore point my side, that people just cannot, developers are not the first thought. Like you have to write code for a living, we have to make this easy for you. So we built that first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I just ask, in the US, given that you&#8217;ve mentioned the healthcare industry, in the US is there an obligation for that particular industry to have things translated into multiple languages? Here in the UK where I&#8217;m based, if you are going to produce something and it&#8217;s going to go into a hospital, for example, I think there is legislation around that. I don&#8217;t know what the cornucopia of languages are, but I know that there is some responsibility there. Is the same true in the US? Does it cover a particular bunch of languages? Is there a minimum requirement that you can have before you can say that&#8217;s done?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, there is a minimum number of, relative minimum number of, languages. It varies state by state, and it&#8217;s for the in-person experience. If you show up to the hospital and you only speak Spanish, they have to have someone in the building that speaks Spanish, or a translator available by phone. Or if you speak Russian, or Czech, or Slovakian. And they have to take care of you, and they have to treat you, and they have to give you care, and then they hand you the directions to leave in English.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They send you your email notifications in English. After just saving your life in Croatian, they then hand you an English sheet of paper with the directions on how to get your next step care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The obligation, you know, Canada has that hard list obligation of two languages, French Canadian and English. But the US is sort of the in-person experience, but not the digital experience. Not your emails, not your text messages, your notifications. None of that is compelled to be in multilanguage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s turn our attention away from healthcare and just think about, I don&#8217;t know, like an e-commerce store or something like that. I guess this whole idea of getting things translated just makes perfect sense over there as well. Because for the last 10 years we&#8217;ve been all getting more and more into buying things online from our mobile phones, in the comfort of our own homes, sitting in an armchair and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And increasingly, a lot of the properties are crossing international borders, so it&#8217;s not difficult for me to buy from a US company, or a European company that isn&#8217;t based where I am, knowing that the shipping and everything will be taken care of. But I guess the language component, for me, I am only an English speaker. So if I, for example, was to come across a great deal on a French website, I wouldn&#8217;t know what it was because it would simply be in French. So I guess there is a real good economic argument if you are hoping to participate in international trade, there&#8217;s a really good compelling argument to get behind this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:01] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> There really is because e-commerce is one of the ones that is, once you fulfill the product, you&#8217;re done. You&#8217;ve shipped it. Some amount of people will call support, some will email, some will use chat. For the majority, overwhelming majority, of e-commerce sales, it&#8217;s ship it, and you&#8217;re done. You really don&#8217;t care if the person that spoke only German. You ship them the great product, maybe you have multi-language directions if they need directions, we should be designing products that don&#8217;t need directions, like a T-shirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yes, the ability for a website and e-commerce to have those additional keywords in those native languages adds billions of potential customers. We did the analysis, and if you just cover Hindi, Chinese, English, French, and German, it&#8217;s about five languages, you add about 4.2 billion potential customers. You&#8217;re adding millions of new keywords. You&#8217;ve spent so much time, most of our WordPress, and the Woo people, spend so much time optimising their titles, their descriptions, their framework for communication on their products, and then that&#8217;s it, it&#8217;s in one language. And it&#8217;s perfect, it&#8217;s beautiful, but it really doesn&#8217;t serve them for 4 billion customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We support about 140 languages. There&#8217;s about 40 languages that cover 8 billion people. Those searches are the key. You can expand at no cost, your SEO presence, just by having the translations built in in a search engine optimised way. And e-commerce fulfillment, all your tools, that&#8217;s an email and chat. The phone one, you&#8217;re going to struggle with, you may have to build some extra capabilities. That&#8217;s where the 4 billion customers need to make enough revenue for you to have some support for them. But if you have 4 billion new customers available to you and you don&#8217;t have the revenue, I&#8217;d like to question your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But from an e-commerce standpoint, selling globally is super easy now. Woo handles the transactions, handles the currency, you can get some plugins for that. You can do the fulfillment. It&#8217;s super easy to cover all the taxes, but you forgot the descriptions. You forgot the titles, the tags, the meta tags, all of that stuff. And the AI translation these days, because you need a special language model, you&#8217;re using special descriptions, and they&#8217;re really good at this. It really is a known thing to translate, and it&#8217;s super easy to adjust and bring in that new traffic. And I think that&#8217;s the important thing about e-commerce, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If we rewind the clock, I don&#8217;t know, 25 years or something, before the internet had taken off, apart from a bunch of really nerdy academics at CERN or something like that, the idea of owning a shop which would be communicating globally was really more or less pie in the sky. You know, there are a few giant companies that we all know of that were crossing international boundaries, car manufacturers and things like that, these giant entities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But people who had a regular shop, which you might describe as a bricks and mortar shop, they&#8217;re not going to be doing that because they&#8217;re locally based, there&#8217;s no prospect of doing that, all of it is completely out of bounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then along comes the internet. Suddenly the boundaries are collapsing. And although it&#8217;s still probably out of bounds for many people, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly obvious to any store owner that you can ship things. All of that shipping capability has been taken care of, the logistics can be taken care of by somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s this missing piece. And I guess, again, if we rewind the clock about 25 years. The idea of translating things must have been fabulously expensive, because for every piece of text that you wished to translate, presumably you had to get a human being to read it, spend time wrangling it, and then giving you the translation, which you would then need to print in some way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, the advent of AI, and I know that AI is all the rage at the moment, but it does seem like a lot of the AI stuff is kind of hype. And some of it might have utility, but much of it doesn&#8217;t seem to have utility. But it really feels like the translation piece is really credible. I don&#8217;t know how perfectly accurate it is, whether it&#8217;s 95% from English to French, say, or 99.9, I don&#8217;t really know, but because that&#8217;s such a logical thing to do, it does seem like an area in which a computer could excel at. Is that the case? Is translation from one language to another, do computers do this increasingly well, accurately?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:18] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, computers are doing it very well. And it is a different AI than the ChatGPT. ChatGPT, Llama, some of those things are terrible at translations, you need a special one for it. And the special ones are getting of standard, by the book translations very good. They&#8217;re still very bad at a couple of things, colloquialisms. We have a great phrase, six of one, half a dozen of the other, that doesn&#8217;t make any sense in Spanish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We lose such great things, like there&#8217;s a wonderful Spanish word, an event called the quinceañera, which is your 15th birthday party. There&#8217;s cultural significance in language that we lose. And we are trying to fix that. Everyone&#8217;s trying to fix that. It&#8217;s as bad as it&#8217;s going to be. But as far as formal communication goes, if you were setting a date and a time for an event, or you were describing what is best be described as a pair of shoes, or fixed product file folders, or something like that, it does very good at those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t do good at tone and colloquial mannerisms. But other than that, it&#8217;s pretty good. The AI translations are getting so good. And the cost to review them. So I was once on a project years ago, and this is before this. They built an app, then they sent it to a translation company with no context, so it didn&#8217;t say what was on the page. So there&#8217;s this wonderful place in the world called Turkey. There&#8217;s also a wonderful piece of food from a bird called turkey. And so here you are with the word Turkey, the country, or turkey, the meat, being all across your website. So even humans without context get it wrong. And so you really need that context engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have this wonderful thing in most websites called the back button, we do that. We also as humans have a part of our body called the back. So in other languages, those aren&#8217;t the same word. And those type of things, humans get wrong so often because they just see the word back, and they just see the, most translation tools that send them over to the company to even manually do it, they do it one word at a time. One line at a time. And there&#8217;s no context, so they&#8217;re just like, I guess it means the country, it&#8217;s capital, I guess we&#8217;re not talking about food, but it was a recipe guide and it&#8217;s your turkey dinner. And so those are the type of things that even humans get wrong still.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the management of it, back to developer friendly. Could you imagine getting emailed a spreadsheet every week as you&#8217;re trying to go to prod? You&#8217;re building a website, here you are, new post, new blog, new product. Okay, I got to email, and I got to check my email, and then I got to save it on that one, and I gotta create a new one, and then I got to save it again because, oh no, I changed the description, now I have to go back to the translator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because in your native language, every keystroke, comma, everything matters. So the human translate, I got to go back, and now I have an entire workflow added to my post and pages. And I love my post and pages, I just want to go in and type and hit save. I barely want somebody else to review it. This is WordPress, we&#8217;re cowboys, we go right to prod. We hit save, we hit publish, we hit draft for a little bit, but we&#8217;re going to prod. And that&#8217;s the difference with these older systems and how to do this is that. With humans involved, you either have to have a huge team or you have to do it yourself, and it still impacts your workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real problem with translations is it&#8217;s so time consuming. It&#8217;s so much effort. We thankfully have a connected enough world that we can find a chain between every language on Earth. We can find a person who speaks English to French, we can find a French person who speaks German, we can find a German person who speaks Polish, and we can connect the whole world, great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s got to get much faster, and we have to connect the world. If we could talk to each other like this, this is where we want to go. This is what I want to do. I want this multi-language, Star Trek had it right. The universal translator built into our ears is the correct technology. Every interface you look at is in your technology, localised to your context. That&#8217;s the vision. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You were talking about a workflow there. The AI presumably is significantly quicker, because if you were to be employing humans to do this, presumably you&#8217;d send an email with the text, wait a little while, maybe a day, or a week, or whatever it may be, and then it comes back, and then you&#8217;ve got to then copy and paste that into the blog post. And I realise that there are WordPress plugins out there that will handle that more or less seamlessly on the back end of your website as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m guessing that AI can handle, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve got a, I don&#8217;t know, 1500 word article or something, I&#8217;m going to guess, I actually don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;m guessing that it could translate that in moments. Be it with all the caveats of how accurate it is and what have you. It&#8217;s a fairly straightforward amount of time, so that you could see the results in seconds. Is that accurate?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:49] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, as a software architect, I can no longer abide by anything longer than three seconds. So our average response time is 1.2 seconds, over at FluentC, and then we are trying to see if we can get that down. That seems too slow to me. And so 1.2 seconds for a whole article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can you translate multiple languages simultaneously? Maybe on the FluentC backend, it&#8217;s actually queuing them and doing them one at a time. But would I be able to, for example, say, okay, my target audience is the Chinese market, the Japanese market, the Philippines market, throw in, I don&#8217;t know, Vietnamese and a bunch of other things, you know, languages that I&#8217;m really not that familiar with. Can I get the same result? 1.2 seconds later or thereabouts, they will all be taken care of and ready to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:30] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s phenomenal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:32] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, we built a multithreaded. We have different channels for each language, and basically you can hit 140 languages, don&#8217;t do it, you don&#8217;t need some of these languages. Some of these are like, we&#8217;re thinking about adding Klingon and Kardashian, we&#8217;re talking about mythical languages. If you&#8217;d like to speak Elfish from Lord of the Rings, we&#8217;re working on that too. We do parallel processing. So we handle all of them in about 1.2 seconds. So in about one second, two seconds, you&#8217;ll be able to have all 40 languages, five languages, downloaded to your copy of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned that ChatGPT, which is the one I think most people are familiar with, you mentioned that that is not quite as robust for the language translation. What is the difference then between the one that you are using? What is that one called, and how is that different? Is it just purely built to do the job of translating one language to another?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:17] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, so the regular ChatGPT, the Llama, they&#8217;re only fed documents in certain languages. And they can read, they&#8217;re fed French documents, it&#8217;s all about access to data. This is why we have an accidental bias in AI. We&#8217;re only feeding it English content and, you know, we&#8217;ll say Western languages because that&#8217;s all we have access to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have very limited documentation written in Swahili. There are very few books. There are very few books in Hebrew. The Arabic books do not have the wealth of digital knowledge. There are so many books in Arabic that are not digital. They&#8217;re handwritten books, they&#8217;re handwritten things from historical precedents. But every book written by Charles Dickens is online. Almost everything written in the King&#8217;s English, every bit of Shakespeare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some of these other cultures do not have the digital free access for these AI companies to ingest. And their models, their tokenisation, their transformers, all of that stuff on their side is not designed to go from token to language, it&#8217;s designed to go from token to token. So you need a specific large language model, and a neural net just tied to multilanguage. So Google Translate, DeepL, AWS Translate, those are the big players in the game. And then what we&#8217;ve done is we&#8217;ve built a layer on top of them. And we&#8217;ve built the FluentC LLM to be context driven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead of translating one word, we&#8217;re sending in FluentC context. So because we&#8217;re connected to your WordPress site, we know all of your pages. We know all of your about. We know your tagline. We know your title. We know all of that stuff about your site, and we can include that, and we process the context to make sure we have the context right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we do a scoring algorithm across the big cloud translation engines to really drive a good output. So we&#8217;ll know if it&#8217;s a bad translation. And then, you know, we&#8217;ve just recently launched an edit capability, so if you do notice, you can just go in and hit edit, and change. But yeah, the ChatGPTs do terrible translations, and it&#8217;s just not designed for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So when this podcast episode airs, I will use an AI, and we&#8217;re both speaking in English, and it&#8217;s pretty good with the UK accent that I have, and I have no doubt that it will be excellent on the accent that you have. So I will feed the audio into that, and within a minute, less than a minute, it will have transcribed that audio. And it will have done, to my eye, about 95, somewhere between 95 and 97% accurate. There&#8217;s always little bits, for example, it&#8217;ll just mishear the slur between one word and another, and so it&#8217;ll misunderstand that word, but it&#8217;ll do a pretty good job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing about that is, it&#8217;s just trying to do one word at a time, you know, discreetly. What&#8217;s that word? What&#8217;s that word? What&#8217;s that word? But then if I was to get that translated, let&#8217;s say, into another language, French, German, whatever we pick. When I&#8217;ve had the opportunity live to use Google Translate, it&#8217;s kind of interesting watching that happen because on the screen as I&#8217;m saying English, I&#8217;ll see the Italian words being printed out, and then there&#8217;ll be like a little pause, and things sometimes get deleted in real time. And so somehow it&#8217;s thinking, okay, that word wasn&#8217;t what I thought it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I&#8217;m trying to say is, when it&#8217;s translating, it&#8217;s not taking one word strictly at a time, because that would just be junk. We know that the order of French sentences, for example, is entirely different. They put words before other words and so on. The order in English is completely different to the order in French. Presumably you have to take that into account. So it&#8217;s not just, if we were to watch this happening, it&#8217;s not linear. It must take the whole sentence as a whole, and then have a guess, and then rewrite its guess. How does that all work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:49] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, and it works by, the more you give it, the better it is. So a one word translation, turkey, meat, country, in English. But if you give it a paragraph, and you start talking about a city in Turkey, and you start talking about a neighborhood, and you give it context. You have to have context of everything else you&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A word, a phrase, you&#8217;re at a bar versus you&#8217;re at church. You&#8217;re at your doctor&#8217;s office versus just walking down the street. Those are contextual elements you have to give to those models so they know who you&#8217;re talking to. If you put relationships between two people, a producer and a customer, a transaction. Or a mother and a daughter. Those are different contexts, and they&#8217;re going to speak differently to each other. And you have to feed all of that in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s where pre-processing translations is a really important thing. The Google Translate on Chrome does a great job, it just doesn&#8217;t have all the context. But the context of translations is key. Where we&#8217;re talking, why we&#8217;re talking, when we&#8217;re talking, those are all different things in every language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, do you have a plugin which is linking up to your SaaS backend to do this? And how does that interface with, I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s say the block editor. How do I, for example, if I created just a post, or a page, or something like that, how does it all look? Do you have a version on the repo, or is this just a premium thing? How does it work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:10] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Oh yeah, the FluentC plugin is on wordpress.org, and that was a big challenge for me. Coming back to the community, I was unaware that there were standards, and that took a few months. I didn&#8217;t know comments had to end in a period. That was a long-term feedback in my first publication, I&#8217;d go a week and then I&#8217;d have comments wrong. It&#8217;s like, okay then, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s critical to the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the FluentC plugin works in the background. Every time you post or publish anything, we pick it up, and then on that traffic we then store the translation locally to your copy of WordPress without object duplication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that, being in WordPress so long, WPML and Polylang have been running the game for, I don&#8217;t know, since the beginning. And the object duplication was always a problem to me. I can&#8217;t grow WordPress to enterprise scale if I have a German version of the page and an English version of the page, I can&#8217;t integrate that content. If I have an e-commerce flow, we talked to some people, and I have a backend not in WordPress, and I&#8217;m feeding WordPress and Woo in my front end, I can&#8217;t have five copies of the same product. I can&#8217;t have object duplication. I need product number seven, I need all my backend systems to go to number seven, I can&#8217;t have a different order ID and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we really built the plugin to solve that problem. And the FluentC plugin, it&#8217;s on wordpress.org, and you just download it, install it, sign up, pick your languages. We&#8217;re giving away a free language still, so there&#8217;s one free language out of the gate, and then you can add and subscribe to more of those, though one language is free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So let&#8217;s say, for example, I&#8217;ve got a product with an ID of seven, and I want that product to have five languages. We don&#8217;t need to get into which ones, but five languages. Is the product ID for all of those seven? You are saying, does that differ from other solutions that may be out there? And we&#8217;re not going to get into the competitive differences and what have you but, is there, a difference there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the options that are available, they might create different IDs because they&#8217;ll have the German one, and the Spanish one, and what have you. Whereas you are saying, it&#8217;s all handled in ID of seven. And if that is the case, how does it do the translation? How does it pull out the English text and swap it for the German on the fly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:16] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yes, thankfully the fantastic developers in the community at WordPress has given us hooks. And so as the hooks render the front end, and as they&#8217;re done, we intercept the hooks, we run some processing on it, and then we store up right before it&#8217;s viewed. So we have tricked WordPress into thinking there&#8217;s a German page. We have modified the URL, so it&#8217;ll be dash de, and then it&#8217;ll be the product name. And so we have tricked WordPress using hooks and standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor is super fun. That was super fun to get that all integrated. Because for most of the cases, we found that most people actually don&#8217;t speak Japanese. Most English producers of content do not speak Japanese, so they don&#8217;t want to be bothered by it. And then as you go through that workflow, what always bothers me is anything that gets in the way of publishing. We&#8217;re independent free thinkers, we&#8217;re self publishers, right? The whole goal of WordPress is independent publishing, right? It was originally a blogging platform, and it was meant for us to get our word out there and communicate in an internet that didn&#8217;t support it. But FluentC plugin is designed to be seamless, and if you want to control it, you can. But other than that, you just ignore it. And I hope you just go to my app and hit subscribe, and then you never touch it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How do you, on the backend, how do you see, are you able to see the German translation? Does it sort of store the German in a meta field somewhere, or?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:33] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, actually we just published it yesterday, that you&#8217;re actually able to, as of yesterday, go in and see all of the translations. We use transients, and so we&#8217;re using transients in the WordPress database, and it&#8217;s super fast because you never hit my cloud. Once it comes a way back to you during that initial load, that 1.3 seconds per page thing like that, then it&#8217;s right from your page, and right from your server. You don&#8217;t call back. You&#8217;re not dependent on me after you get the translation, so it&#8217;s super fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a software architect, I&#8217;ve been doing that for 20 years, performance is key. If we slow down all of WordPress because we want to support more people, that&#8217;s counterproductive. We can&#8217;t add billions of new people to our sites and then, oh yeah, everyone&#8217;s now one and a half, two seconds slower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I don&#8217;t know how closely you keep your eye on the roadmap for WordPress, but we&#8217;re in phase three of the Gutenberg project. And at the moment that, broadly speaking, could be categorised as collaboration. There&#8217;s a whole bunch of other things thrown in there as well, but the idea of having some interface which we can communicate with in real time with other people, and that&#8217;s yet to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the fourth phase is all about this topic, is all about multilingual and what have you. And I imagine that there is an opportunity there, but also maybe there&#8217;s a little bit of trepidation. Because, although the scope for this phase four hasn&#8217;t been exactly ironed out really, and there&#8217;s a little bit up in the air because we haven&#8217;t got there yet. I don&#8217;t know what your thoughts are, whether or not you are building a business which may end up being completely upended by WordPress Core. Or whether you think actually there&#8217;s a opportunity for me here because I&#8217;ll be able to bolt into whatever is built. So that question is, it&#8217;s not very targeted, but hopefully you&#8217;ve got an intuition. Phase four is coming, it&#8217;s going to be exactly in the ballpark of what you are doing. So does it offer you an opportunity, or is it something to be worried about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:24] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> We are looking forward to participating in phase four. Now that I&#8217;m actively in the community, I&#8217;d love to help with phase four. We are dreaming of a world where you just use FluentC&#8217;s backend, you don&#8217;t need to install our plugin, be fantastic. If we could get standardisation among the hooks, the translations, the power to do it and edit it, that would be fantastic. We view all of the phase four talk as a super impactful, important upgrade to WordPress, to make it really global publishing software,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So in that scenario, perhaps the intention for you is to pivot away from being a plugin, more to being an API basically. You know, you go to your service in the same way that you do for ChatGPT, for example, and you get a key. And you paste that into some core component of WordPress, which ships with vanilla WordPress, and then your translation has just happened on the fly. That&#8217;s interesting. So that&#8217;s a potential direction you are hoping it might go in, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:22] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, that would be great. If we end up that WordPress does it so well that all of the translation plugins are irrelevant, and now we&#8217;re competing on API qualities, I&#8217;m perfectly fine with that. I&#8217;m perfectly fine with building a better mousetrap and helping WordPress. Honestly, I just want the world to get smaller and make this easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think we&#8217;re going to do fine in that world. I think we&#8217;re going to be proactive, I think the developer tools we&#8217;re coming out with in the next few months, to actually automatically get all of your language files ready to go, and at least one version of translation ready to submit with your plugin, will make the world smaller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think having multi-language themes with 1.2 second response time is pretty good, so that theme developers can start to plug in. We think there&#8217;s still an area around WordPress that&#8217;ll make it better, and then if WordPress can standardise the way it thinks about multi-language, standardise the control mechanisms. We&#8217;ve had to invent a lot of stuff that, once it&#8217;s standardises we think it&#8217;ll be better for everyone. And yes, it will allow more up market entrants, and yes, it will be more open, but that&#8217;s WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What&#8217;s the nature of the LLMs? I know that you drew a distinction between the LLMs that you&#8217;ve decided to use and the layer that you&#8217;ve added on top, and the ones that we&#8217;re all familiar with, ChatGPT and what have you. What I&#8217;m meaning by this is that it feels like a lot of money, in many cases, tens of billions of dollars is pointing towards things like ChatGPT. And we know that Google has deep products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are we worried about a future where only a few of these AI companies are able to offer services? Simply because they&#8217;ve been the ones that have invested so much, and they&#8217;ve become the defaults. Does anything like that concern you at all? That we&#8217;re sort of building something where there&#8217;s going to be a few incumbents, and their AI is going to be so superior to anything else, that we won&#8217;t have an opportunity to use rivals, because they just won&#8217;t be worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:14] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s all around tech though. We have our big six tech firms, they have more money than anyone thought they should have. They have so much power, they have so much control. They could buy all of the competitors in the entire space for less than they lost buying coffee. And that consolidation, that&#8217;s going to be a real problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There almost has to be a WordPress for AI. We have to get an open source AI model that actually is contributed by other people. We have to do, maybe Matt wants to start another thing. And we have to go at this because WordPress and this open source, it serves a real valid purpose. It does keep everyone in check, it does keep everyone in line. The reason it&#8217;s not $25,000 to run out a basic website is because WordPress exists. Self-publishing, open source tools exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the AI goes private, we&#8217;ll call it 1980s versions of software. The eighties existed, we&#8217;ve already seen this. We&#8217;ve seen languages, coding languages that were proprietary. Software that&#8217;s proprietary. We have Java. We know how this goes. We have Objective-C. We have whole languages locked down by a company. If they lock down the AI, we&#8217;re all not going to be able to use it unless we pay them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is not a competitive landscape. We need that openness, we need the WordPress people to really get involved in this because it&#8217;s going to be out of our control, and it&#8217;s going to get self consolidated. It&#8217;s how capitalism works. The market drive to a single winner. It drives unless there are other values than money, and people who see other value, community value, network value, people that actually just want to win and communicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all of this stuff that we get out of WordPress, all of the joy and happiness. We were so happy, I was just at WordCamp Ottawa. It was such a happy place. We&#8217;re all just there to learn, and talk, and teach, and do, and be together, and it&#8217;s so fantastic. And I really love that about WordPress, and we do need that for AI because it is going to get controlled by these mega companies. I mean, Microsoft spent $10 billion, yeah, billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> My understanding is that they&#8217;re potentially also building a $100 billion data center in the very near future as well. You know, just eye watering amounts of money that the likes of you and I, really it&#8217;s difficult to understand the levels that these companies are on. And you imagine that, the more that they can pour into it, the more that they pull ahead in the race, and make themselves so indispensable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And actually that leads me to another, and probably final question. If you are in the technology space, for the last 50 years, it&#8217;s been a tough thing to keep up because technology changes so fast, but some things don&#8217;t change too quickly. Like the CSS spec doesn&#8217;t change all that quickly. So you&#8217;re building, I don&#8217;t know, a page builder, you&#8217;ve at least got a bedrock there and you can work on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How is this for you, in the AI space, trying to keep up? Because it feels like, you know, you blink and things have changed. From one day to the next, something that was working is no longer working. Something which was cool is no longer cool. Some company that you&#8217;d never heard of is now worth a hundred billion dollars, you know. How do you keep up with all of this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:18] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, so we focus on things that I personally, and our company, focus on value. We do not respect this slideware, vaporware version of AI. We have lived through blockchain. We have lived through Web 2.0. I have been doing this for 25 years. I had an AOL disc, I used to use dial up internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are driving to things that actually create value. And those things we&#8217;re chasing, duplicating, replicating, incorporating. And we&#8217;ve gotten good at identifying the stuff that&#8217;s just fluff. And that&#8217;s going to be hard for new people to come in in tech, that they can&#8217;t identify it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we were here through all of this. Like we have been here since containers, when containerisation was going to change the world. And it sort of did, but it sort of didn&#8217;t. And it&#8217;s now just on the tool belt, and it&#8217;s another button in the servers. But it&#8217;s not really, it didn&#8217;t change the world, it didn&#8217;t solve everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it kind of feels to me that, I really don&#8217;t know, I think you could almost flip a coin and see whether AI will be used everywhere, or the opposite. You know, people will just get fed up with it and think, actually, do you know what, the human touch is much better. But it does feel like you are on fairly steady ground because the capacity for AI to do the translation job is so profoundly obvious. It&#8217;s really straightforward. There&#8217;s a direct line between, I don&#8217;t know, the amount of time that it takes and the cost, and what have you. It really seems like a really sensible place to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re kind of going to have to knock it on the head because of the amount of time that we&#8217;ve got available for this podcast. But just before we go, would you mind just dropping a few details about where people can find you? That could be, I don&#8217;t know, a social handle, it could be a website, or an email. What&#8217;s the best place to find you if people want to talk about translating in WordPress with AI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:56] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;m on the Make WordPress Slack. Our website FluentC.ai is our WordPress focus website, F-L-U-E-N-T-C dot A-I, is our WordPress focus website. That&#8217;s a great place. I&#8217;m on LinkedIn. But Slack and wordpress.org are great places to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. Thank you so much for chatting to me today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:16] <strong>Matthias Pupillo:</strong> Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Matthias Pupillo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthias has extensive experience in the technology and creative sectors, and is currently working as the co-founder of FluentC.ai, an AI-powered language technology company. With a background in technology, he’s focusing on developing solutions to enhance communication across different languages and platforms. He’s been involved with WordPress since its early days around version 1.2, and has a rich history of web design and consulting, having worked on hundreds of WordPress websites. But it’s only recently that he’s become more engaged in the WordPress community through events like WordCamp Buffalo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the podcast today we talk about AI-driven language translations, particularly focusing on Matthias’s work with FluentC, which is his translation plugin for WordPress. It supports multithreaded, simultaneous translations of up to 140 languages, enabling your pages and posts to be offered in other languages in just a few moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cover the differences between AI models designed for translation, such as ChatGPT and Llama, which aren&#8217;t specialised for this task, and how his platform builds a contextual layer above those. He emphasises the importance of context and diverse multilingual data in producing high-quality translations. FluentC&#8217;s functionality involves local storage of translated content, in an effort to maintain website speed. This is done using native WordPress hooks and URL modifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matthias also offers his thoughts on the ongoing multilingual support phase of the Gutenberg project, and his hopes for FluentC to evolve from a standalone plugin to an API which could be used by WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the broader implications of AI in translation, the need for open-source models to compete in this rapidly evolving space, and the parallels between AI evolution and past trends like blockchain and Web 2.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the intersection of AI and WordPress, or are looking to enhance your website&#8217;s multilingual capabilities, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fluentc.ai/\">FluentC website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fluentc-translation/\">FluentC plugin</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\">ChatGPT</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://llama.meta.com/\">Llama</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=en&op=translate\">Google Translate</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.deepl.com/en/translator\">DeepL</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/translate/\">AWS Translate</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpml.org/\">WPML plugin</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/\">Polylang plugin</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mvpis/\">Matthias on WordPress.org</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Sep 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Akismet: How to Stop Contact Form Spam on Any Website (99.99% Accuracy)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=284162\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"https://akismet.com/blog/how-to-stop-contact-form-spam/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19881:\"<p>If you have an unsecured contact form on your website —&nbsp;one that doesn’t use any kind of spam-prevention technology —&nbsp;you’ll likely get a lot of time-wasting, irrelevant submissions. That’s because, without some sort of protection in place, contact forms are simply wide open for malicious actors and bots to submit spam.</p>\n\n\n<p>There are several ways you can protect a contact form, whether you’re using WordPress or not. You can <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/wordpress-captcha/\">add CAPTCHAs</a>, make contact forms only available for logged&#8209;in users, or add a smart, automated anti&#8209;spam protection tool like Akismet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Sites that care about the user experience and maximizing conversion rates should almost always choose a solution from that last category —&nbsp;one that stops contact form spam without<em> </em>annoying site visitors.</p>\n\n\n<p>In this article, we’ll go over the most effective ways to stop contact form spam. We’ll also discuss why CAPTCHA is no longer the preferred tool for spam protection and show you what you should be using instead. Let’s get to&nbsp;it!</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-284162\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"the-best-solutions-to-stop-form-spam-in 2024\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The best solutions to stop form spam in&nbsp;2024</h2>\n\n<p>In this section, we’ll walk you through the best solutions to stop contact form spam. We’ll explain how each solution works, as well as its pros and cons, to help you decide which option to implement for your&nbsp;website.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Akismet</h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1095\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image.png\" alt=\"Akismet homepage with the text \" />\n\n\n<p>Over 100 million websites use Akismet to protect against form spam. Once you set up Akismet on your site, it will analyze submissions and determine what is real content and what is&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n<p>Akismet leverages machine learning to do this. The software has removed over 500 billion pieces of spam from the web. Every time it does this, it gets better at identifying spam. It’s gotten so good, in fact, that it boasts an accuracy rating of&nbsp;99.99%.</p>\n\n<p>The best thing about Akismet is that it doesn’t force users to solve puzzles or interact with elements on your site before enabling them to submit a form. Akismet does its work in the background and prevents contact form spam from reaching your&nbsp;inbox.</p>\n\n<p>If you use WordPress, you can easily integrate Akismet <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">with a plugin</a>. Akismet also offers integration options for other content management systems (CMS), including <a href=\"https://akismet.com/support/getting-started/does-akismet-only-work-with-wordpress/#:~:text=While%20Akismet%20is%20most%20used,the%20Plugins%20and%20libraries%20page.\">Joomla and&nbsp;Drupal</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can also integrate Akismet with other types of sites using its API. This makes it a near&#8209;universal solution for spam&nbsp;protection.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-captchas\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. CAPTCHAs</h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"939\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-1.png\" alt=\"example of reCAPTCHA on a form\" class=\"wp-image-284165\" />\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-captcha/\">Completely automated public Turing tests (or CAPTCHAs)</a> are tools designed to help block bots from being able to submit forms. CAPTCHAs are everywhere on the web, from login pages to comment sections and contact&nbsp;forms.</p>\n\n<p>There are several types of CAPTCHAs you can use to protect a contact form. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-recaptcha/\">Google reCAPTCHA</a>, for example, provides CAPTCHAs with visual puzzles that users need to solve or elements they need to click on to prove they’re human. The latest versions of reCAPTCHA don’t require interaction, but you’re free to choose which option to&nbsp;use.</p>\n\n<p>While CAPTCHAs are popular, they do have a few downsides. We’ll explore the cons of using CAPTCHAs later in the&nbsp;post.</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-honeypot\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Honeypot</h3>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-a-honeypot/\">Using honeypots</a> is a creative way to mitigate contact form spam for a website. This method involves setting up an input field within the form and hiding it from human users in some way (typically using&nbsp;CSS).</p>\n\n<p>Although real visitors won’t be able to see the field, they’ll still be able to submit forms as usual. <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/what-is-a-spambot/\">Spambots</a>, on the other hand, are typically configured to fill out every field in a form, including&nbsp;honeypots.</p>\n\n<p>This method can help you identify which form submissions come from bots. You can use that information to filter these messages and keep your focus on real&nbsp;submissions.</p>\n\n<p>Although the honeypot approach can be effective, you’ll still receive contact form spam, which can clutter your inbox. Plus, you’ll need to understand basic CSS to hide a contact form field. If you use a CMS with a contact form plugin, it might not allow you to easily hide&nbsp;elements.</p>\n\n<p>Some spambots are also capable of bypassing honeypot fields. And, you run the risk of real users stumbling into the hidden fields, which can lead you to think their submissions are also&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4-session cookies\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Session&nbsp;cookies</h3>\n\n<p>As you may know, some websites use session cookies to track your information and activity on their pages. This means you can also use cookies to identify bots due to the way they behave on your&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<p>Bot activity can be relatively simple to identify. Spambots often go straight for contact forms, fill them out immediately, and attempt to make multiple submissions. In contrast to how real users behave, they’re also unlikely to interact with other elements on a&nbsp;site.</p>\n\n<p>You can use this information to block form submissions for sessions that engage in suspicious behavior. But this only works if you’re comfortable configuring cookies to detect suspicious&nbsp;behavior.</p>\n\n<p>That process requires you to configure the cookies to flag behavior that you would typically see with spambots. There can be a lot of trial and error involved in this process, and it’s arguably a lot more difficult than using an available tool or service to block contact form&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, this solution is more common among enterprise websites and businesses that have the technical know&#8209;how to implement advanced security measures. Even then, the results you get might not be worth the trouble when there are out&#8209;of&#8209;the&#8209;box solutions you can use to achieve similar (or even better)&nbsp;results.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-email filtering\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Email&nbsp;filtering</h3>\n\n<p>Most modern email clients offer some type of message filtering functionality. You can use these filters to flag emails from specific addresses or those that contain keywords you associate with&nbsp;spam.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1263\" height=\"465\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-2.png\" alt=\"filters and blocked addresses section of Gmail\" class=\"wp-image-284167\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In general, you shouldn’t use email filtering tools to deal with contact form spam unless you get a very low number of messages. For this method to be effective, you need to decide what terms to filter and continue to add new keywords over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Flagging the wrong keywords can lead to situations where your email will falsely flag messages from real users. Identifying these false positives will often require you to spend time in your email’s spam folder, which is precisely what you want to&nbsp;avoid.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-captcha-is-not-the-best option\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why CAPTCHA is not the best&nbsp;option</h2>\n\n\n<p>CAPTCHAs are one of the most common forms of spam protection on the web. You can see CAPTCHAs everywhere, but that doesn’t mean they’re the most effective spam protection method.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>There are several reasons why using them may not be the best&nbsp;option:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>CAPTCHAs negatively impact the user experience. </strong>Some types of CAPTCHAs require users to interact with an element to prove they’re human or to solve one or more puzzles. If you’ve ever had to solve multiple CAPTCHA puzzles to access a form, you know how frustrating this can&nbsp;be.</li>\n\n<li><strong>CAPTCHAs are prone to false positives.</strong> Even humans can make mistakes when it comes to CAPTCHAs. The detection algorithms aren’t perfect, which can lead to situations where a website flags a real user as a bot and prevents them from submitting a contact&nbsp;form.</li>\n\n<li><strong>CAPTCHAs require work to set up and constant updates. </strong>Spambots and CAPTCHAs are constantly trying to beat each other. Some types of spambots can bypass CAPTCHAs with a decent success rate. This means you may need to update your CAPTCHA implementation regularly. Plus, you have to set up CAPTCHAs individually for each form you want to&nbsp;protect.</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>It’s important to note that your experience using CAPTCHAs can vary a lot depending on which service you use. Some CAPTCHAs, like the latest versions of reCAPTCHA, don’t require users to solve puzzles or interact with elements on the web. Even so, it’s safe to say that CAPTCHAs are becoming&nbsp;outdated.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of using a CAPTCHA, consider a <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/captcha-alternatives/\">more powerful alternative</a> to the contact form spam problem, like&nbsp;Akismet.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: the best anti&#8209;spam&nbsp;solution</h2>\n\n\n<p>Most anti-spam tools focus on identifying spam content and bots before they can submit a contact form. Akismet does things differently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The service uses machine learning to constantly improve its spam detection capabilities. That constant improvement has led to the point where Akismet can boast a 99.99% accuracy rate in detecting spam.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>You can choose whether to save spam comments for review or let Akismet discard them&nbsp;immediately.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"918\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/image-3.png\" alt=\"spam filtering settings in Akismet\" class=\"wp-image-284169\" />\n\n\n<p>Akismet will automatically detect contact form spam and filter it for you. The service also offers a host of other benefits, which include the&nbsp;following:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Easy setup. </strong>If you use WordPress, you can set up Akismet in minutes. All you have to do is install and activate the plugin, and it will automatically start protecting your site against spam submissions. This ease of use also applies to installing Akismet on other types of&nbsp;sites.</li>\n\n<li><strong>A more seamless user experience. </strong>The service works in the background and doesn’t involve elements that require user interaction. This reduces the friction of submitting a contact form, which can improve your conversion&nbsp;rates.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Integration with any kind of website. </strong>Akismet offers simple integration protocols for several popular platforms, including WordPress.

If the form doesn’t use some type of security feature, spammers are able to make all kinds of useless and potentially&#8209;harmful submissions through the form. These can include links to other websites, promotions for fraudulent services and products, and automatically&#8209;generated&nbsp;content.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-does-contact-form-spam-affect-a website\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does contact form spam affect a&nbsp;website?</h3>\n\n<p>Contact form spam shouldn’t affect your website on the front end, unless the form is open to some kind of attack that can compromise your site’s security (<a href=\"https://jetpack.com/blog/what-is-sql-injection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">like SQL&nbsp;injection</a>).</p>\n\n<p>In most cases, the biggest downside of contact form spam is having to deal with it. This spam can quickly fill up your inbox and make it harder for you to separate the real messages from the fake&nbsp;ones.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-is-akismet-considered-the-best-solution-for-contact-form spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is Akismet considered the best solution for contact form&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Most solutions that focus on stopping contact form spam do so at the expense of the user experience. CAPTCHAs, for instance, force users to solve problems or click on elements before they can submit a form. This can reduce the number of people willing to use the form and can even make them inaccessible to those with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Akismet is highly effective in stopping contact form spam, with a detection accuracy rate of 99.99% for spam content. Plus, Akismet doesn’t impact the user experience whatsoever, as it works in the background during form&nbsp;submission.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-honeypot-fields-and-how-do-they work\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are honeypot fields, and how do they&nbsp;work?</h3>\n\n<p>A honeypot field is an element in a contact form that only bots should be able to engage with. You can create one by using CSS to hide a field in plain sight or through a plugin that will handle this for you. Regular users will skip the hidden field, but spambots&nbsp;won’t.</p>\n\n<p>Once the honeypot is set, you can filter all contact form submissions that fill out the field. You may also be able to blocklist the IP addresses that make the submissions, depending on which contact form tool you’re&nbsp;using.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-effective-is-captcha-in-preventing spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How effective is CAPTCHA in preventing&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>CAPTCHAs are among the most popular solutions for protecting your website from contact form spam. Their popularity makes them a significant target for attackers, who are constantly devising ways to bypass them using automated&nbsp;tools.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also not uncommon for CAPTCHAs to flag real users as bots. Overall, CAPTCHAs can be highly effective, but they’re not without several&nbsp;downsides.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-spambots-bypass-honeypot-fields-and captchas\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can spambots bypass honeypot fields and&nbsp;CAPTCHAs?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, some spambots can bypass honeypot fields and CAPTCHAs. Attackers are constantly trying to bypass form security measures, and that means creating new bots and constantly updating them so they remain&nbsp;effective.</p>\n\n<p>Akismet bypasses this problem by focusing its spam detection tools on the content of the form submissions. The service also learns from each submission, which makes it the most accurate spam detection and prevention tool on the&nbsp;market.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"can-akismet-protect-against-all-types-of spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can Akismet protect against all types of&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>Spammers and bots tend to target any public form on websites. Akismet can protect all the forms on your site by monitoring submissions. It does this without you having to set up individual protection for each form, as is the case with&nbsp;CAPTCHAs.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"where-can-i-learn-more-about akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I learn more about&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n<p>You can visit the <a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet features page</a> to learn more about how its spam protection functionality works.

Hi, my name is Adam Weeks, and this is…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Hi, I&#8217;m Emma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Hey, Emma! Oh my goodness, it&#8217;s been a little while. We&#8217;re getting to catch up, and have we got a show for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Oh, do we?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yes, yes, yes! This is Woo Biz Chat. This conversation came about because I was thinking of this topic, and I don’t know that we’ve really talked about it much. However, I have a new contract, and I’ve been working with 10up. 10up is one of the biggest agencies in WordPress, and they’ve grown so much because they do certain things really well. I’ve been so impressed with the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I hear repeatedly is about that &#8220;last 10%.&#8221; That’s really what gets them over the finish line with some of these big enterprise projects. It’s been a lot of fun getting to know this talented team. One of the people on this team, her name is Haley, and she is hilarious. She’s a project manager and very good at communicating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, this morning I hopped on Slack, as you do, and she had a very succinct but thorough rundown of an event we needed to be updated on. She did it in a way that was clear, funny, interesting, and timely. So, let’s talk about a few of those things we’re going to discuss in this episode. If you’re curious about asynchronous communication, this might be something unique—not to commerce so much—but in Woo, I imagine we have to work asynchronously. We’re in our Slack, we’re in our email, and we need to have a good foundation and a good way to communicate asynchronously. We’re going to dive into all those topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we start, is it okay to swear? When can you be funny? When can you not? All these things—so that’s what we’re going to get into. Also, Emma, one of the reasons we picked this topic is that you are very good at it, and I’m going to learn from you today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Except for all of…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Let’s start us off. Tell me your general thoughts on asynchronous communication. Do you have a philosophy? What are your thoughts from a high level?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />That&#8217;s such a loaded question! It&#8217;s like, how do you pack everything into one nicely typed-out message as a response?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />It’s hard, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />It really is. Practice doesn’t make perfect, but it gets close. And everybody’s different. One thing we can start off with is that there are so many different audiences, and people know you at different levels, so everyone will interpret communication differently. But just to quickly start off, for people who don’t know—what even is async communication? Basically, it&#8217;s communication where the participants don’t need to interact in real-time. It doesn’t have to be face-to-face. It can be messages or information exchanged on Slack, Messenger, Teams, project management tools, emails, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is different from synchronous communication, which is what we’re doing now—calls, meetings, phone calls, live chat, stuff like that. Asynchronous communication is when a message is sent, and you deal with it when you can. So, what are the best ways to deal with it from there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Alright, asynchronous communication. We use it a lot in this industry because of the nature of the work. Time zones are another reason for async communication. Your day might not overlap with your coworkers or clients completely. It can be helpful to get something moving, and then when you go to sleep, someone else is waking up and takes it from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, I’m going to ask you a few different questions. You’re good at this! What is one thing you try to do when using async communication? What’s a guiding principle for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />It’s actually kind of funny because we communicate like this a lot due to our time zones. Yesterday, I sent you a message before bed like, “Here, check out these show notes,” and then I checked it after your full day. But it wasn’t always that easy. Well, with you, yes, but with other people, maybe not as easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stand by this: over-communicating is never a bad thing when it comes to async communication, especially if the person has never met you before. Whether it&#8217;s a quick “huddle” on Slack or Zoom, if someone’s never put a tone or voice behind your words, they might interpret it in many different ways. So, clarity and context are essential. Sometimes, I reread a message I sent and think, &#8220;I know what that means, but maybe the person reading it doesn’t.&#8221; Over-communicating is never really over-communicating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />You are never penalized for over-communicating. The person may be annoyed, but that&#8217;s okay. They can skim it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Exactly. One person might say, “I already know all this; why did you write so much?” But maybe 99 other people reading it will go, “Oh, it all makes sense now. I don’t have to ask any follow-up questions.” Amazing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />It’s like taking notes in a meeting. You think, “Oh, I’ll remember that.” Nope, I won’t remember that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />No way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />My brain doesn’t work that well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />My brain ain’t braining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />My brain ain’t braining! And sometimes, you’re taking notes for someone who wasn’t at the meeting. If someone gets hit by a bus—this sounds terrible—and they weren’t there…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />They’ll have the notes communicated async. Just kidding! Because they’re…dead. No, wait, sorry. Too far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Asynchronous communication. What was I saying?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />You were talking about taking notes for someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Right, your notes need to stand on their own for someone who doesn’t have any context. You won’t be penalized for over-communicating, and the person you&#8217;re communicating with might also be forgetful. You won’t be penalized for clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />A hundred percent. But in addition, I’d recommend—depending on the type of communication—if you can, jump on a short call. Putting a voice behind the words they’ll read on a screen helps, especially if it’s the first time you’re giving feedback. You don’t have to do this every time, but I recently did this at work. I was in a call with some team leads, hosting a meeting. I can’t remember all the details, but at the end, they asked for feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d never given this person feedback in written form before, and I made sure there was enough context, examples, and action points in the message. But then I thought, “You could read this the wrong way.” So I said, “Hey, can you hop on a quick call? I’ll send this feedback afterward.” It was just a quick Slack huddle. After that, the next time I sent feedback, it was clear, and I didn’t need to overuse emojis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure! Here’s the continuation of the corrected transcript:</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Wait, wait…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />You couldn’t see me, but I also did cat claws, like &#8220;rawr.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Everyone&#8217;s imagining that now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I thought, &#8220;She asked for feedback, so let me jump on a quick call to give it to her.&#8221; After that, when I sent the written feedback, it was very clear. She could now imagine my personality behind the words, without me having to overuse emojis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Oh, all the emojis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />So you bring up a good point. We’re talking about asynchronous communication and how to use it, but there’s also the point of <em>when not</em> to use it. I’ve come up with this framework: information is shared quite well asynchronously—whether through emails or Slack—but if you’re trying to connect with someone, solve a problem, or if there’s some emotional element involved, it’s better to hop on a quick Zoom call, or use Slack’s huddle feature. Sometimes something that might take back-and-forth exchanges in Slack—or even be misunderstood—can be solved in two minutes over a call. Don’t try to solve problems over a text message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I agree. If there’s no quick decision being made or communication is being lost due to a lack of context, then move to another method. Whether it’s a call, a huddle, or a voice note—even a quick voice recording can help bridge the gap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Oh yeah, voice notes are great. You can record a quick message. Another thing I don’t use enough is video recording—where you record your screen and say, &#8220;Hey, this is what I’m seeing.&#8221; They can hear your voice and see exactly what you&#8217;re seeing, which can be super helpful. So, there are lots of ways to handle async communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so we briefly talked about emojis—emoticons? I don’t know the difference. How do you use them? When do you find them helpful, or when are they annoying?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />One of the things I love about working with Hosting or switching to different Slack groups is the custom emojis they have. They’ve got all these little dancing characters. When I move to WordPress Slack, or back to our group, I’m like, “Where’s the dancing cookie?” or “Where’s the cat spinning on a Roomba?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have a &#8220;Hall of Fame&#8221; of my own custom emojis, like Emma smirking, Emma flabbergasted, Emma disappointed. And I’m sad when I go to Messenger or another platform that doesn’t let me use them. Sometimes, all you need is an emoji to express yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Okay, wait—Bob, if you’re listening, we need to get all of Emma’s custom emojis on Slack. I want them all!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yeah, I think I can make them myself. We’ll have to see. But we kind of have this weird thing where the original smiley face—the one with no teeth—has turned into this passive-aggressive emoji for some reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />The thumbs-up emoji—is that okay?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Oh yeah, thumbs-up is okay. We kind of use it as the end of a conversation, like, “This is done. No need to continue.” It’s like when you’re dating and don’t know how to hang up the phone—you hang up first, no, you hang up first. Someone sends a thumbs-up, and that’s it. It’s all good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />It’s all Gucci! What about the hands-raised emoji? You know, the two hands in the air?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yeah, we use that one a lot, along with the &#8220;grinning&#8221; emoji, which is like, “Oops, we’ve got to work on that now.” And of course, the sweating smile when something doesn’t go as planned. The shrug emoji is also a big one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />I love the shrug emoji.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Oh, totally. It adds a little bit of emotion to your communication. Sometimes, just a simple emoji makes the message more relatable—especially if you’re trying to send kudos or hype someone up. But don’t go overboard with emojis either, because then it can distract from the actual message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Too much emotion, not enough content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Exactly. And on that note, there are some emojis that don’t age well or might accidentally offend someone. Sometimes an emoji or symbol might become controversial or inappropriate, and then someone calls you out on it. If it wasn’t malicious, just delete it and learn from it. There are boundaries to emoji usage, but they can be a fun and helpful tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />So, the takeaway here is: use emojis, but don’t overdo it. They’re helpful in adding some humanity to otherwise black-and-white text. You can only use so many exclamation marks. Do you use exclamation marks a lot to add emphasis?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I have this weird thing against exclamation marks. Stop shouting at me! Nobody’s that excited. I tend to avoid using too many. However, I’ve caught myself doing it when I’m really excited. Someone once gave me feedback about that—because I tend to end messages with double periods or double stops, like &#8220;..&#8221; instead of a single period or an ellipsis. They said that it could come across as unhappy or cold if I didn’t add more information or an emoji. So, I switched that up!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Communication evolves, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yep, if you’re trying to ensure people know you&#8217;re happy or positive, throw in a smiley face or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />That’s a great point—feedback can be really helpful for improving how you communicate. So, what we take away from this is: give feedback on how someone’s async communication is going, and assume the best in them, especially when you don’t hear back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When someone doesn’t respond after you’ve put effort into your message—there are crickets—how do you handle that situation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yeah, that happens. Especially because my team spans 10 time zones, there’s no way everyone is online at the same time. So, one thing we do is react to messages with an emoji once we&#8217;ve read it or acted on it. Sometimes that gets old, but it becomes second nature—react with a fun emoji so that people know you&#8217;ve seen the message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I’m all for tagging people. Not aggressively, but if 24 hours have passed and you know they’ve been online, tag them again. Ping them until they see it! It’s easy to miss a message in Slack or Teams, especially if it pops up briefly and you lose it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Exactly. Sometimes you see a message, but then it disappears, and you can’t find it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Right, or if you accidentally open it on your phone, you’re kind of out of luck. So don’t feel bad about tagging people—ping them a few times. From my perspective, I’ve never gotten mad at someone for tagging me multiple times. If I missed it, I appreciate the reminder. You could also use a loading emoji, like “I’m working on it, but give me a minute.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />So, aggressively tagging—got it. Another thing I’ve found helpful is to avoid asking seven questions in one message. If someone knows the answer to six of them but not the seventh, they might delay responding altogether. Break it down to one or two key questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the continuation of the transcript with corrections:</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />So, break it down into one or two key questions, and when you get that response, they can address those first. When you overload someone with too many questions, they’re more likely to ghost you—not because they mean to, but because it feels overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, when you do get a response, you might see a little checkmark or a “done,” or they might write “received” or “great question, let me follow up.” That’s something I try to do more of—if someone asks me something complex and I don’t have all the answers right away, I at least let them know I’m thinking about it or working on it. It helps keep the conversation moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yeah, that’s important. And if your company already has established procedures, emojis can be helpful for tracking communication, too. You can use a &#8220;loading&#8221; emoji, the eyes emoji, or a “working on it” emoji to show progress, and then update it when you&#8217;re done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also want to touch on the formatting of async communication. If you need to ask more than three questions, it can get confusing. If you have a multi-part conversation, I recommend sending a separate post for each topic so they can each have their own dedicated thread. That way, less information gets lost compared to a giant message where everything is lumped together. Otherwise, you might end up having to schedule a call because there’s too much going on in one message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />That’s a great tip. Another thing I picked up from my friend Haley at 10up is the importance of consistency and rhythm in communication. If you’re managing a project and have a weekly meeting or update, try to send your agenda or summary at the same time every week. People appreciate predictability in communication—it helps build trust and reduces surprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good tip Haley mentioned was drafting your message in Google Docs and getting peer review before you send it out. What’s your take on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I think it depends on the message, but yeah, I definitely agree with using Google Docs for longer or more formal messages. I’m more comfortable writing in Google Docs because I have Grammarly and other tools to help catch mistakes. Also, if it’s something important or if I need input from others, I’ll ask someone to review it before sending it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, I’ll ask for feedback like, “Does this have enough context? Does this sound like me? Do I sound upset or annoyed?” Having another set of eyes on a message can help make sure it&#8217;s clear and professional before you hit send.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yeah, I love Grammarly Pro for the win! It&#8217;s not just about catching grammar mistakes—it’s also about ensuring that the message aligns with what you want to convey. Especially with important messages or anything client-facing, it&#8217;s good to slow down and have someone else review it. Don’t rush to publish it—take a beat, have someone look it over, and make sure everything’s in order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one trick I’ve learned is to set expectations upfront. Instead of saying, “When you have a minute, can you look at this?” say, “I need to send this out by 7 PM; would you mind reviewing it before then?” That way, they know how urgent it is, and if they can’t get to it in time, you’re still able to send it by the deadline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Exactly! And it helps to be clear about expectations, especially in different time zones. Also, if something is optional for some people but mandatory for others, it’s important to tag those people directly so they know they need to review it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had an example today on my team where someone sent a message with a summary and action points, and then said, “You have until the end of the day to challenge this, or I’m proceeding.” That’s a great way to set a clear timeline and let people know what the plan is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />That’s a great way to handle it—give a clear deadline for feedback and move forward if no one challenges it. There’s a phrase I like: “It’s unkind to be unclear.” Sometimes we try to be too nice, saying, “If you have time,” or “whatever works for you,” but in the end, it just makes things more confusing. Being direct is better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I agree! It’s like when I speak, I tend to say, “Maybe, possibly, kind of…” but in messages, I’m much more direct—“Do this” or “This needs to happen.” It’s about clarity and getting things done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yeah, it’s unkind to be unclear. You want to be kind and polite, but also clear. It’s a balance—don’t leave people guessing, but also don’t be overly harsh. And if you’re giving people a timeline, tell them when you need something done, and if it’s okay if they don’t respond, let them know that too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Exactly. And when you’re writing these messages, also be aware of the language you use, especially when it comes to different cultures and inclusivity. You don’t want to unintentionally offend someone, so choose your words carefully. And if you do make a mistake, apologize and learn from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yes, that’s a great point—be mindful of your audience and the words you choose. And if you mess up, own it and apologize. We’re all learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, we’ve covered a lot, but we still have one more sensitive topic to discuss: swearing. Is it okay to swear? When is it okay, and when is it not okay? What’s your take on dropping swear words in async communication?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Personally, I have a bit of a potty mouth, so I’m used to swearing in my day-to-day life. But in async communication, it depends on the company culture. At Hostinger, for example, it’s common for people to drop the occasional F-bomb internally, but I wouldn’t swear in a message to someone I just met or on their first day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think swearing is something that comes with familiarity—it’s more about knowing your audience. If it’s internal and you have a good relationship with the person, swearing might be fine. But for external clients or more formal situations, it’s definitely a no-go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Yeah, I agree. Don’t be the first to swear. If you’re building a relationship or working with a client, keep it professional. There’s a time and place for it, and you want to be sure it’s appropriate before you start using swear words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, you want to be authentic. So if you’re comfortable swearing in certain contexts and it feels natural, it’s okay to do that—but be mindful of the situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Exactly. Be yourself, but be cautious. And remember, in async communication, everything can be screenshot and shared. So, if you’re swearing in Slack or anywhere else, be aware that it could end up somewhere you didn’t intend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />That’s a great point. Always assume your message could be shared, even in private channels or DMs. If you wouldn’t want your message to be forwarded, don’t send it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing I try to do in async messages is start by being human. It’s easy to get straight to the point in async communication, but it’s nice to start with a “Hey, how are you?” or “Hope your week is going well” before diving into the business stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I agree! My greetings change depending on my energy levels. Sometimes it’s “Hey,” sometimes it’s “Hello!” with lots of o’s, or even a dancing cactus emoji. But I always try to start with a personal touch because we’re not just talking to robots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should ask how someone’s doing before diving into work, especially if you haven’t spoken to them in a while. Just like in person, you don’t walk up to someone and immediately ask them for a status update. Start with a greeting, then get into the conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Exactly. It helps build rapport and makes the conversation feel more human. It also shows that you care about the other person beyond just the task at hand. Any final thoughts as we wrap up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />I had one, but it’s gone now. My brain isn’t braining anymore!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />The best part is you can tell me later—async communication!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yes, exactly! I’ll ping you later. But seriously, if anyone listening has questions or specific scenarios where they want help improving their async communication, feel free to send me a message. I love helping with that kind of stuff!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />Absolutely! And if you, the listeners, have any tips or strategies you use for async communication that we haven’t covered, please let us know. We’d love to hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />Yes, and if you have any other topics you want to discuss with us, we’d be more than happy to have you on the show. We can talk, and, you know, shoot the poo—uh, I mean, shoot the shit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam:<br />And that is a sign that we’re wrapping up this episode of Woo Biz Chat!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emma:<br />This is why Emma doesn’t close the show. Goodbye, and thanks to all our listeners!</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-border-color has-light-gray-background-color has-background has-small-font-size has-global-padding is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-21 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p class=\"has-secondary-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9acf640b7ba38a84a982fc35d618387f\">This show is sponsored by&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-20 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-4 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-17 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-9 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-16 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"525\" height=\"525\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Airwallex.jpg?resize=525%2C525&ssl=1\" alt=\"Airwallex\" class=\"wp-image-80258\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-10\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.airwallex.com/integrations/woocommerce?utm_source=701Nn000009vJ0mIAE\">Airwallex</a></strong>: With <strong>Airwallex</strong> merchants are no longer forced to convert their foreign incoming payments into their home market currencies and they can use the funds to pay suppliers internationally.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-5 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-19 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-background-color has-background wp-container-content-11 has-global-padding is-content-justification-left is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-18 wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<img width=\"500\" height=\"500\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/dothewoo.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Omnisend-square.jpg?resize=500%2C500&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-78802\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-container-content-12\"><strong><a href=\"https://your.omnisend.com/onlywoo_dothewoo\">Omnisend</a></strong>: Whether it&#8217;s for integration into your Woo product, or building sites for clients, <strong>Omnisend</strong> is the solution for email and SMS marketing with their CRM solution for WooCommerce shops and your own website.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong><em>Woo BizChat</em></strong>, hosts <strong>Adam Weeks</strong> and <strong>Emma Young</strong> dive into the world of asynchronous communication, sharing insights on how to effectively communicate across different time zones and platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They explore the do’s and don’ts of async communication, the importance of over-communicating, using emojis and tone to convey clarity, and when to switch to a real-time conversation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam and Emma also tackle the tricky topic of swearing in professional contexts, the value of getting feedback, and how to build rapport while keeping communication clear and human. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Over-communicating is better than under-communicating</strong>: In asynchronous communication, providing thorough context is essential, especially if the person hasn’t met you in person or doesn’t know your communication style. Clear, detailed messages help avoid misunderstandings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use emojis strategically</strong>: Emojis can add warmth and tone to otherwise cold, text-based communication. However, don’t overdo it—use them to enhance clarity and express emotions without distracting from the message.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Break up complex messages</strong>: When you need to ask multiple questions or cover several topics, break your message into separate posts or threads to keep discussions organized and avoid overwhelming the recipient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Timing and consistency matter</strong>: Whether it’s a recurring meeting agenda or an important message, being consistent with when and how you communicate helps establish predictability and reliability in your workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When to switch to real-time communication</strong>: If a conversation becomes too complex or emotional, it’s often best to switch from async to synchronous communication. A quick Zoom call or Slack huddle can save time and prevent misunderstandings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Be mindful of your audience</strong>: Different cultures and communication styles may require adjusting your approach. Always be respectful and considerate, especially when using acronyms, jargon, or informal language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Feedback is key</strong>: Regularly ask for feedback on your communication style to improve. It helps you ensure that your messages are clear and interpreted as intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Set expectations clearly</strong>: Don’t be afraid to set clear deadlines and expectations in your messages. It’s unkind to be unclear—people appreciate knowing when something is due or when to take action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use peer reviews for important messages</strong>: When sending out important or client-facing communication, consider drafting in a tool like Google Docs and getting feedback from peers before hitting send.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Know when it’s okay to swear</strong>: Swearing in async communication depends on the company culture and your relationship with the person you’re communicating with. Keep it professional, especially in client-facing conversations, and avoid being the first to swear.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 11 Sep 2024 09:38:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:207:\"HeroPress: How WordPress and My Work Help Me Stay on Board During the War – Як WordPress та робота допомагають мені залишатись на плаву під час війни? \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=7335\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:198:\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-wordpress-and-my-work-help-me-stay-on-board-during-the-war/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-wordpress-and-my-work-help-me-stay-on-board-during-the-war\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34865:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/090624-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" />\nHere is Lana reading her own story aloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#ukranian\">Це есе також доступно українською.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Lana Miro, shortened for Svitlana. I’m a Partnerships Manager at Crocoblock. This article is my personal story about how WordPress and my work have been helping me stay on board during the war in Ukraine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-brief-introduction\">Brief Introduction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m 28 years old, born and raised in Mykolaiv, Ukraine. It’s a peaceful, small city (<em>before the war, about 400,000 people lived here</em>). I never thought about moving because travelling and exploring other cities for short periods was enough for me. Mykolaiv was always my comfort zone, where I felt safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This city provides me with a sense of peace – the river, the parks… the river – yes, I’m a fan of water. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f30a.png\" alt=\"🌊\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://x.com/Lana_Miro/status/1822876256439857433\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"807\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CleanShot-2024-09-04-at-17.34.57@2x-1024x807.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7336\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-introduction-to-wordpress\">My Introduction to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I began my journey with WordPress in 2017 when I started an internship at TemplateMonster. That’s when I discovered this incredible platform that captivated me with its scope and possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At TemplateMonster, I worked as a Partnerships Manager. At that time, the company’s niche was templates for various CMS platforms. So, I’m well-acquainted with all of WordPress’s competitors. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f604.png\" alt=\"😄\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During my three years with the company,<strong> I realized that WordPress was the largest and most interesting CMS for me.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The community and the number of people creating content about WordPress is enormous!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A variety of plugins and templates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>An interesting and intuitive dashboard.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, during the Covid pandemic, I started experiencing issues with my back and mental health, so I decided to take a one-year break. I left the project and rejoined another Holding project a year later – Crocoblock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crocoblock was a breath of fresh air for me because of its amazing community and cool plugins that I wanted to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26a1.png\" alt=\"⚡\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />My main tasks involved finding partners for collaboration, organizing events, and more. I’ve described partnerships in more detail in my free guide – <a href=\"https://lanamiro.medium.com/free-ebook-wordpress-partnerships-basics-61635d13f82a?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------\"><em>WordPress Partnerships Basics</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-invasion-how-to-work\">Invasion: How to Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The war with Russia has been ongoing since 2014, so the Russian invasion in 2022 wasn’t a surprise to us. However, what was surprising – that bombs, missiles, and artillery could be used with such intensity in the 21st century.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first two weeks, we were paralyzed. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f614.png\" alt=\"😔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-beginning\">The beginning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first two weeks of the war were a real shock. We were all paralyzed, but the Crocoblock team quickly came together, creating an operational chat to support each other. This was a time when<strong> words, actions, and even just being present in the chat meant so much</strong>.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f499.png\" alt=\"💙\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, one of our employees immediately went to the army, so we collected money, and our developers bought everything he needed to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I checked my work email on the second day of the escalation. Lying in the basement, with the internet barely reaching, I decided, “<em>I’m relatively safe, so I can respond to partners</em>.” I reviewed critical messages, and let them know that we were okay and would respond as soon as we adapted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few days later, we decided to<a href=\"https://crocoblock.com/blog/wordpress-community-supports-ukraine/\"> write a blog post</a> to let the Community know we were okay and to explain what was happening. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f625.png\" alt=\"😥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After two weeks of lying in the basement (<em>yes, my family of nine spent two weeks in the basement, occasionally sleeping in the corridor or bathroom for safety</em>), a bomb was dropped near our street, and that became a critical moment for our family.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By a majority vote, we decided to move to the western part of our country.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-adaptation-period\">Adaptation period</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we were safe, I was able to start working at 100% (<em>okay, maybe 80%, as 20% of me was still in shock </em><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f623.png\" alt=\"😣\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />). Of course, the news, conditions, and stress affected me, but <strong>work helped me get back into a routine and begin to adapt.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work became my lifeline.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It brought me back to life, giving me a <strong>sense of stability</strong> when everything around me was falling apart. We recorded a video message for our clients, which was an important step not only for synchronization but also for my personal recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to mention the numerous words of support we received afterward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We once again realized that <strong>Crocoblock clients are the best</strong>.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49a.png\" alt=\"💚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the team immediately moved to safer cities or went abroad. But some stayed in Mykolaiv, and Anna, our CEO, was in an occupied city – Kherson. But that’s her story. I was incredibly happy when she finally left the occupation, and <strong>we exhaled in relief</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three months (<em>which felt like a year</em>), my husband and I decided to move closer to Mykolaiv to be near his parents. It was safe there, but due to the constant changes, my depression reached its peak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, part of Kherson was liberated, and Mykolaiv was being shelled less frequently, so we decided to <strong>return home</strong>. That’s when I started treatment with a psychiatrist. She helped stabilize my condition and bring me back.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/231b.png\" alt=\"⌛\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4af.png\" alt=\"💯\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> <strong>2022 was the hardest year for me and my family</strong>, but the ability to work and be part of the WordPress community helped me<strong> Just Continue</strong>. At the end of the year, I decided to thank everyone who supported me, asked how I was doing, joked, and was kind to me in a p<a href=\"https://lanamiro.medium.com/thank-you-wordpress-community-3eb235dae1f1\">ost on Medium</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-team-changes\">Team changes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the war impacted our team, and I immediately noticed how management changed its approach to<strong> focus on caring for each team member</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64c.png\" alt=\"🙌\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> We started having training sessions based on the team’s requests (e.g.,<em> anxiety management</em>), management helped with healing supplies (<em>since there are blackouts or Internet issues in Ukraine</em>), and relocation if needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the war, our HR team introduced the <strong>IDP (Individual Development Plan)</strong>, which allows you to outline your development for the year, focus, and receive better feedback. This helped me during my depression.

More than 100 missiles and drones were launched this morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We woke up at 7:30 a.m. and saw the attack begin. Thanks to monitoring channels, we can continue to live and hide in shelters when they announce. I had breakfast, did some exercise, and started working with sirens in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next came the emergency electricity offs, as one of Russia&#8217;s goals is to break our energy system and plunge our country and people into chaos. But besides anger and hatred, I no longer feel anything for them.

Я – партнерський менеджер у Crocoblock. Ця стаття – моя особиста історія про те, як WordPress і робота допомагають мені залишатися на плаву під час війни в Україні.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-короткий-вступ\">Короткий вступ</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Мені 28 років, я народилась і проживаю у місті Миколаїв, Україна. Це спокійне, не велике місто (до війни, тут проживало близько 400 тис. людей). Я ніколи не задумувалась про переїзд, бо мені було достатньо подорожей і дослідження інших міст на короткий період. А от Миколаїв завжди залишався моєю комфортною зоною, де я почувала себе в безпеці.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Тут є те, що дає мені відчуття спокою – річка, парки… річка – так, я фанат води.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f30a.png\" alt=\"🌊\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://x.com/Lana_Miro/status/1822876256439857433\" class=\"kb-advanced-image-link\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"807\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CleanShot-2024-09-04-at-17.34.57@2x-1024x807.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-7336\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-знайомство-з-wordpress\">Знайомство з WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Я почала свій шлях з WordPress у 2017 році, коли прийшла на стажування до TemplateMonster. Тоді я відкрила для себе цю неймовірну платформу, яка захопила мене своєю масштабністю і можливостями.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>У TemplateMonster, я працювала менеджером з партнерств. На той період ніша компанії – це шаблони для різних CMS. Тому я обізнана з усіма конкурентами WordPress. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f600.png\" alt=\"😀\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Протягом 3х років роботи в компанії, я зрозуміла, що WordPress найбільша і найцікавіша для мене CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Чому?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ком’юніті та кількість людей, які створюють контент про WordPress – величезна!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Різноманітність плагінів, шаблонів</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Цікавий і інтуїтивний дашборд&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>У 2020, під час Covid, я почала більше відчувати проблеми зі спиною і ментальним здоров’ям, тому вирішила зробити паузу на 1 рік. Звільнилась з проекту і поновилась через рік у інший проект холдингу – Crocoblock.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crocoblock став для мене новим ковтком повітря, бо тут крутезне ком’юніті і класні плагіни, з якими хочеться працювати.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26a1.png\" alt=\"⚡\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />Моїми основними завданнями було пошук партнерів для співпраці, організація заходів, і т.д. Більше про партнерства, я описала у своєму, безкоштовному посібнику – <a href=\"https://lanamiro.medium.com/free-ebook-wordpress-partnerships-basics-61635d13f82a?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------\">WordPress Partnerships Basics</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-повномасштабна-війна-як-працювати\">Повномасштабна Війна: як працювати?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Війна з росією триває з 2014 року, тому для нас не був сюрпризом наступ росіян 2022. Але сюрпризом було, що у 21 столітті можуть використовуватись бомби, ракети, та артилерія в такій інтенсивності.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Перші 2 тижні ми були паралізовані. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f614.png\" alt=\"😔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-початок\">Початок</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Перші два тижні війни були справжнім шоком. Ми всі були паралізовані, але команда Crocoblock швидко згуртувалася, створивши оперативний чат для підтримки один одного. Це був час, коли слова, дії і навіть просто присутність у чаті значили дуже багато.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f499.png\" alt=\"💙\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>(<em>наприклад, наш співробітник одразу пішов воювати, тому ми зібрали гроші і наші розробники купили все що йому потрібно для початку</em>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>На робочу пошту я зайшла десь на другий день ескалації. Лежачи в підвалі, інтернет трошки дотягував, тому я вирішила – “<em>Я відносно в безпеці, отже можу відповісти партнерам :D</em>”. Я оглянула критичні повідомлення, дала знати що у нас все окей і відповімо якомога скоріше як адаптуємось.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Через пару днів, ми вирішили <a href=\"https://crocoblock.com/blog/wordpress-community-supports-ukraine/\">написати блог статтю</a>, щоб дати знати нашим клієнтам та партнерам – ми в порядку і що взагалі відбувається. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f625.png\" alt=\"😥\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Через 2 тижні, лежачи в підвалі (<em>так, 2 тижні моя сім’я з 9 людей провела в підвалі, періодично сплячи в коридорі або ванній кімнаті дому для безпеки</em>) недалеко від нашої вулиці скинули бомбу і це стало критичним моментом для нашої сім’і. І методом голосування – ми виїхали на захід нашої країни.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-період-адаптації\">Період адаптації</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Будучи в безпеці, я змогла почати працювати на всі 100 <em>(ну окей, на 80%, 20% мене ще досі було шокована</em><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f623.png\" alt=\"😣\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />). Звичайно, новини, умови і стан стресу вплинули, але робота допомогла повернутись в режим і почати адаптуватись.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Робота стала моїм рятівним колом. Вона повернула мене до життя, дала мені відчуття стабільності, коли все навколо руйнувалося. Ми записали відеозвернення для наших клієнтів, що стало важливим кроком не лише для синхронізації, але й для мого особистого відновлення.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Не кажучи вже про численну кількість слів підтримки, яку ми отримали потім.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ми ще раз зрозуміли –<strong> Crocoblock клієнти – найкращі</strong>.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f49a.png\" alt=\"💚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Частина команди одразу переїхала в безпечніші міста або виїхала закордон. Але дехто залишався в Миколаєві, а Анна – наша CEO взагалі була в окупованому місті – Херсон. Але це вже її історія. Я була неймовірно рада коли вона нарешті виїхала з окупації і ми видихнули з полегшенням.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Після 3х місяців (<em>для мене вони тягнулись як рік</em>), я і мій чоловік вирішили переїхати ближче до Миколаєва до його батьків. Там було безпечно, але через зміни, моя депресія досягла апогею.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>На щастя, звільнили частину Херсону і Миколаїв став менше обстрілюватись, тому ми вирішили повернутися додому. Де я почала лікування з психіатром. Вона допомогла стабілізувати мій стан і повернути себе.<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/231b.png\" alt=\"⌛\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4af.png\" alt=\"💯\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />2022 рік був найскладнішим</strong> для мене та моєї сім’ї, але можливість працювати та бути частинкою WordPress ком’юніті допомогло мені вистояти та допомагати моїй країні. В кінці року, я вирішила подякувати всім, хто мене підтримував, запитував як справи, жартував, був добрим до мене, у <a href=\"https://lanamiro.medium.com/thank-you-wordpress-community-3eb235dae1f1\">своєму пості на Medium</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-командні-зміни\">Командні зміни</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Звичайно війна вплинула на нашу команду і я одразу помітила як менеджмент змінив підхід до управління з акцентом на <strong>піклування про кожного члена команди</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f64c.png\" alt=\"🙌\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />У нас почались тренінги згідно запитів команди (<em>наприклад, боротьба з тривожністю</em>), менеджмент допомагає з засобами заживлення (<em>так як в Україні бувають блекаути/проблеми зі світлом або зв’язком</em>) та релокацією за потреби.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Під час війни, наша HR команда ввела IDP (Individual development plan), який дозволяє окреслити розвиток людини протягом року, сфокусуватись і отримувати кращий фідбек. Мені це допомогло під час депресії. Бо війна внесла свої корективи і я стала більш тривожною, хаотичною і важко було сфокусуватись.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f469-200d-1f4bb.png\" alt=\"👩‍💻\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />Важливою є постійна підтримка менеджера</strong>. Мій менеджер – це Анна, наша СЕО. Від неї я постійно отримую фідбек, який так часто потрібен, щоб краще працювати.

Більше 100 ракет і дронів було випущено зранку.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Зранку ми прокинулись о 7:30 і побачили початок атаки. Завдяки моніторинговим каналам, ми можемо продовжувати жити і підглядати коли треба сховатись в укриття. Я поснідала, зробила зарядку і почала працювати з серенами на фоні (це значно краще ніж вибухи).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Далі почались аварійні відключення, бо одна з цілей росії – зламати нашу енергосистему і ввести нашу країну і людей в хаос. Але, окрім злості і ненависті я більше не відчуваю нічого до них. Ми підготовлені, маємо пауербанки, екофлоу, резерви води і готові працювати наповну, щоб країна вижила.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4aa.png\" alt=\"💪\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />Зараз ми активно працюємо над підготовкою до нашої 2гої WordPress Agency Summit у вересні і це допомагає мені відчувати, що я можу бути корисною ком’юніті. <a href=\"https://crocoblock.com/wordpress-agency-summit/\">Доєднуйтесь</a>, це безкоштовно.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Також стараємось більше брати участь у заходах WordPress.

This is an All Things WordPress and WooCommerce podcast, and this is the Emerging Tech series. I am your host, Dave Lockie, and for this episode, we&#8217;ve got Thomas Shellberg, who is representing the Applied AI team from Automattic, and therefore one of my colleagues. Hi, Thomas. Thanks for joining us today. How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Hi, Dave. I&#8217;m doing great. Thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Perfect. So today we wanted to talk a little bit about what Automattic is up to with AI, and you are the best person I can think of to talk us through that. So, I guess maybe first let&#8217;s just start with you. What&#8217;s your background? How did you come to be at Automattic, and when did you join the Applied AI team, and why? What were you doing before, and what was so appealing about jumping into this team?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Yeah, thanks. So, I&#8217;ve actually been at Automattic for nine years now. Before then, I was working for WooThemes, which was before it became WooCommerce and before it was acquired by Automattic. I&#8217;ve been working with Woo for a long time. Yeah, one of the originals— I think we were about 35 people. It was a very scrappy, small company when I joined. I was hired as a Happiness Engineer in 2014, and I worked there for five years before I started to get really interested in programming. I became essentially the first junior developer at Automattic in 2020 and became a full-time engineer. I was working on Woo Pay and some other Woo payments and projects, extensions, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty much after GPT-3 came out, I started to get really interested in the LLM (large language model) side of machine learning and AI. Before that, I had done some AI courses, the more traditional machine learning courses by Andrew Ng, from the famous Stanford course. But yeah, I started to run some experiments and began thinking about ways that WooCommerce could utilize this new LLM technology and some of the magic that apparently came out of this &#8220;black box.&#8221; I was quite vocal about my experiments and ideas, and we eventually created a Woo AI team—sort of an experimental, short-term team to explore what kind of projects in WooCommerce could utilize AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our biggest achievement was the Woo AI plugin that we shipped to about 10,000 customers, and it still gets used to this day. The plugin mainly helps with generating product descriptions, product titles, categories, and even includes a background removal tool for images. After that, I moved into the Applied AI team, which focuses more on WordPress.com functionality and how we can improve it. I’ve been on the Applied AI team since May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />What a lovely story! Coming from a Happiness background and ending up really in the thick of it, the cutting edge of what we&#8217;re trying to do as a business—it must feel like a great ride you&#8217;ve been on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Yeah, and I think everyone should do some kind of tech support or customer support in their lifetime. It really helps you develop a level of empathy for your customers that you can’t replicate just by using the product short-term. I think it really, really helps in development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Yeah, it&#8217;s almost unlimited in the number of ways someone can misunderstand, misuse, or break a piece of technology. I&#8217;ve done a lot of customer support myself over the years, so, yeah, strong plus-one from me there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />You can never fully predict how people will use your products, especially something as flexible as WooCommerce or WordPress. People find interesting ways to use a product that you never thought of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Totally. My background is in agency freelancing and then running an agency, and I always used to say there are a million ways to build a WordPress site, but only a handful of ways that are actually right or good for the long term. I think that remains true to this day, and it&#8217;s definitely something I’m passionate about in my day-to-day work—figuring out when to be more opinionated about how to build successful sites and stores using Automattic’s suite of products and services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, there are different tribes or mini-ecosystems within the greater space. For example, if you’re building on Elementor, there’s a whole bunch of stuff that comes along with that. But Automattic has its own de facto set of opinions. We think that if you&#8217;re going to do e-commerce on WordPress, you should be using WooCommerce, Gutenberg, and Jetpack. Trying to find that balance between flexibility and customizability while also having opinions and guardrails to ensure product compatibility and a consistent user experience—both on the front and back ends—is a really interesting problem to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />I think that&#8217;s a really interesting point, and it&#8217;s very relevant at this moment. We’ll get into some of the projects we’re working on, but that’s exactly what we’re dealing with—finding the balance between freedom and opinionated patterns, presets, or decisions about how a website should look and what an AI should do for you, versus leaving things open for customization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Awesome. That’s a nice and natural segue. Why don’t you tell us some of the things that you’re up to—maybe some of the things you’ve shipped and are iterating on, and maybe some of the active projects you’re working on now? Then we can leap into the future a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Sure. I’d say we have three major projects. One of them is public, and one is sort of behind the scenes but kind of public. The first one is the Jetpack AI Assistant. It’s a contextual AI assistant that lives inside the Gutenberg editor. It’s highly contextual, so if you select a text block, you’ll see AI options like &#8220;translate this text,&#8221; &#8220;rewrite this,&#8221; or &#8220;correct mistakes,&#8221; which is really cool. It’s built into the editor, so it doesn’t add any extra level of abstraction or anything unfamiliar. It’s just part of what you already know. So, that’s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an extra plan inside of Jetpack. It can also generate images, helping to make your pages and posts more interesting and appealing. Instead of hunting for a stock image that might not fit perfectly, you can use AI-generated images that match your needs. It’s really good for outlining posts too. Usually, the hardest part of writing is starting from nothing, and having an outline really helps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Yeah, I totally agree. There’s always the challenge of a blank piece of paper. You have a rough idea, but how do you shape it quickly? When you&#8217;re writing casually, you can leave things half-finished and come back to them, but if you&#8217;re a professional marketer or under pressure to produce content regularly, you need to quickly form a good idea of what the end product will look like. I think AI helps with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, it’s great for keeping you in a particular mode—whether you’re creating or editing. I often find that when I’m in a creative mode, the editorial side of my brain starts creeping in, and it gets distracting. With an AI assistant, I know I can focus on the creative part now and rely on the machine to handle the editing later. What kind of feedback have you received about how the Jetpack AI Assistant is being used?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Oh, that&#8217;s a good question. I’d have to get back to you with specifics, but I do know we have quite a few users who love it. Feedback has been good. I don&#8217;t have the numbers right now, but I can get them to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Cool. Sorry to put you on the spot there. No worries! Hard questions, even if we&#8217;re on the same team, Thomas. Good stuff. Alright, so project number one is the in-editor assistant. What’s project number two?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Project number two is called Odie. Odie is basically our in-house WordPress.com chat system. You can think of it as a chatbot platform. It has access to and is trained on all WordPress.com documentation, so it provides accurate answers to common questions from WordPress.com users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One bot, called WaaPu, is available via a chat interface natively within the WordPress.com admin area. When you search for help, that’s the first thing that pops up. It’s a conversational interface, and it’s actually doing quite well. We make it clear that it’s powered by AI because we want to be as transparent as possible. The main benefit is that WordPress.com users get help super fast, often resolving their issues right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 30–40% of support volume is handled by this chatbot, with high customer ratings. It’s really good for repetitive questions that come up from documentation and don’t require creative troubleshooting. People appreciate getting immediate answers rather than waiting for a response from a human.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />That makes total sense. If you’re in a rush, you’ll settle for a quick coffee out of a machine rather than waiting for a handcrafted brew. I guess ticket completion rates are higher than expected?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Yes, higher than I expected! What’s cool is that our Happiness Engineers (HEs) help improve WaaPu’s quality. Tickets answered by Odie are reviewed by HEs, who give them ratings, so it gets better based on what our Happiness Engineers would reply with. There’s a human feedback loop improving it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />And the name Odie—wasn’t that a cartoon dog from Garfield?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Yes, technically it’s short for Odysseus, but yes,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>there’s Odie from Garfield too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Maybe there’s a double meaning there. Hopefully, it&#8217;s smarter than Garfield&#8217;s Odie! It sounds like it is. I didn’t realize we were seeing such an impact. Often people don’t know what question to ask—they know what they’re trying to achieve but not the terminology to use. Chatbots can crystallize what they’re really asking. Do you think that’s fair?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Absolutely. There are multiple benefits. By automating simple and repetitive questions, Happiness Engineers have more time for complex, creative problem-solving, which is more stimulating and uses more of their knowledge. When I was a Happiness Engineer, I worked on the most complex tickets at WooCommerce, and it was much more engaging than handling password resets all day. So, there’s a second benefit for people craving a bit more complexity and creativity in their job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />That’s about moving up the value chain and building stronger relationships with customers. Instead of answering repetitive queries, we can focus on novel challenges with our customers, which adds value. It ties into that earlier point about balancing customization with guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, tell us about project three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Project three is ongoing and codenamed Big Sky. It’s our most ambitious project—essentially an AI assistant for building your first website on WordPress.com. We’re targeting people who recognize WordPress.com as a great place to build a site but don’t know how to design one. Being launched into a blank page can be intimidating, so as part of onboarding, this assistant helps generate an initial site layout that looks good. Then, the user can tailor it without needing to know anything about web design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to make the process intuitive, even for users with no prior experience with WordPress. We&#8217;re really excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Interesting. So, this essentially teaches users by allowing them to change something already set up? They can see how blocks are composed, and by editing the blocks, they learn how the tool works. It’s easier to tweak something than to start from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Absolutely. It’s very hard to start from scratch. Even if you have a rough idea, it’s easier to see something similar and make it your own. It speeds up the process massively. The challenge we’re working on is ensuring users don’t feel dropped into the deep end with Gutenberg. We want to guide them through the experience without overwhelming them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />I can see how this reduces the tension of tweaking vs. starting from scratch. It helps users stay creative and experiment, allowing them to take control in ways that feel natural.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Exactly. We&#8217;re targeting business owners who want to focus on their business and the creative aspect of running it. We want to lower the barrier to entry by making website building intuitive, rather than making them learn web design to run their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Totally agree! This also feels essential for the future of websites. Many other digital channels, like social media, are intuitive and easy to use from the start. We need websites to have a similar experience—something that just works without needing expert advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Absolutely. Our idea is to grow with the user. Initially, the site may not need complex functionality, but as their business grows—whether that means taking payments, adding members, or shipping inventory—we’ll be there with modular solutions that meet their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />That makes sense. It aligns perfectly with our mission of democratizing publishing. Thanks for sharing everything that Automattic’s up to. I’ve learned a lot today, and I’m sure our listeners have too. Will you be at WordCamp US?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas:<br />Unfortunately, I won’t be there. I’m in Germany and have a broken foot, so flying isn’t an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave:<br />Oh no! Best wishes for a swift recovery! Thanks again, Thomas, and take care.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of <strong>All Things WordPress Woo, Emerging Tech</strong> series, host <strong>Dave Lockie</strong> chats with T<strong>homas Shellberg from Automattic&#8217;s Applied AI team</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They explore Automattic&#8217;s recent AI projects, including the Jetpack AI Assistant for content creation, the Odie chatbot for in-house WordPress.com support, and Big Sky, an ambitious AI-driven tool for helping users build websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas shares insights on the role of AI in enhancing user experience, reducing complexity, and supporting small businesses. They also discuss the evolving landscape of e-commerce, AI&#8217;s potential to democratize web development, and the future of AI-powered solutions in WordPress and WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Projects</strong>: Automattic is working on several AI-driven projects, including the Jetpack AI Assistant for content creation, Odie, an in-house chatbot for WordPress.com support, and Big Sky, an AI assistant that helps users build their first website. Each project aims to simplify tasks and improve user experience across WordPress and WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AI in Content Creation</strong>: The Jetpack AI Assistant integrates directly into the Gutenberg editor, offering users contextual suggestions for rewriting, translating, and improving content. It can also generate images and outlines to help users overcome the &#8220;blank page&#8221; problem when writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Automation in Customer Support</strong>: The Odie chatbot, used on WordPress.com, handles about 30-40% of support volume, answering common and repetitive questions quickly. This allows Happiness Engineers to focus on more complex and creative customer problems, improving overall support quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Simplifying Website Creation</strong>: Big Sky, Automattic&#8217;s most ambitious AI project, aims to help users—especially those with no web design experience—build their first website on WordPress.com. By generating an initial layout, users can easily modify their site without starting from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Empowering Small Businesses</strong>: Automattic’s AI tools, particularly in WooCommerce, aim to democratize e-commerce by giving small businesses access to tools that are typically available to larger companies. These tools can help artisans and entrepreneurs create professional websites without the need for technical expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Balancing Flexibility and Opinionation</strong>: A recurring theme is the challenge of balancing flexibility with providing opinionated guidance. Automattic&#8217;s goal is to maintain the customizable nature of WordPress and WooCommerce while offering users more structured, streamlined experiences with the help of AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Future of E-commerce Analytics</strong>: Automattic is also working on improving WooCommerce analytics with AI-driven insights that can provide actionable feedback for merchants. This includes personalized suggestions on how to improve store performance based on industry benchmarks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AI’s Role in Democratizing Technology</strong>: The discussion highlights how AI can lower the barriers for small business owners, reducing the complexity and cost of building and managing websites, and allowing them to compete with larger brands.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 10 Sep 2024 00:23:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: WordPress Community Team to Close Inactive Meetup Groups by September 16, 2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=161213\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-to-close-inactive-meetup-groups-by-september-16-2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2245:\"<p>Automattic’s Community Engagement Specialist, Devin Maeztri, has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2024/09/06/final-reminder-inactive-meetup-groups-will-be-closed-in-september-2024/\">announced</a> that the WordPress Community Team will close all inactive meetup groups by September 16, 2024.

Organizers have until <strong>September 16</strong> to confirm if they wish to remain active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the list, 22 meetups have already requested closure. Spain leads with six closure requests, followed by the USA (4), France (3), and Indonesia (3).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meetup groups that fail to respond will be removed from the WordPress Chapter Meetup Program.

How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />I&#8217;m well, Gigi, and yourself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Doing well too, thank you. So, for this podcast, let me introduce myself. I am Gigi JK. I run an eCommerce engineering company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />And I am Steve Tamulewicz with eCreations out of Phoenix, Arizona. Also a WordPress and WooCommerce platform engineer as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Alright, so a little bit more about my company. We are a WooCommerce certified agency. However, we have expertise in multiple eCommerce platforms, and we differentiate ourselves from most of the other agencies by being an eCommerce engineering company. The reason why is that, for us, eCommerce is like a car rally, and in order to win the race, you need a great driving team—that&#8217;s your marketing agency—and then you need a great hardcore engineering team to figure out what the right car engineering you need to have and what the right gears it should have. That&#8217;s where Virtina comes in. I started as a software engineering company, Virtina. Then we saw this need in the marketplace for a good software engineering company, just like a good car engineering company. There was a need for a great eCommerce engineering company. So we shifted the focus from being a software engineering company to an eCommerce engineering company. The last point is, 90%—no, 98%—of my clients are small to medium-sized businesses. But once in a while, we get a client like Amazon or the world&#8217;s largest democratic country. When they get into trouble, and somehow our name gets passed around, they come to us, and we do a good job at it. And we have other agencies also work with us behind the scenes, in front of the scenes, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />So, we, on the other hand, are focused on Woo. So, when we have clients who come to us with a certain challenge, we want to understand what our client&#8217;s end game is. And a lot of times, if they&#8217;re sold on a different platform than Woo, I haven’t done my job. But if they are, I will turn them over to XII, or if they need someone in their specific geographic region, we work with other verified experts as we are, and as you are, Gigi. But you&#8217;re absolutely right when you say that we have to understand the client, and I love the race car analogy. We’ve got to put together the pieces. I still need to make a living, but if it’s not right for the client, I’m not going to put myself in that position. So, most of our clientele is probably mid-to-enterprise level, and I think you and I are probably one of six or seven in the country who get that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always get the calls to fix things, but a lot of times, when other agencies or freelancers say, &#8220;This can&#8217;t be done,&#8221; you call one of us guys. So, we like the data analysis. We like working with them to make sure that they come up with the right solution, whether it be Woo or not. If it is, great, we&#8217;ll work with them, and we&#8217;ll start doing the architecture and going through that. If it&#8217;s not, then we have no problem referring. As a background, Gigi and I, we met—was it in &#8217;16 or &#8217;17?—up in Seattle at WordCamp. It was a good party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Just before COVID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Yes. So, I think that kind of sums up what we do. I was thinking about this podcast, Gigi, and I wanted to ask you—you brought up a good segue—did COVID affect you? And if it did, did you become busier? Did you slow down? How did that happen? What was your experience with the whole COVID thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Very good question. By being in this space, competing with other digital marketing agencies, with our background, we have specific challenges every day, right? I&#8217;m talking specifically, as I mentioned, we are a software engineering company focused on eCommerce, right? We are not a marketing agency, and we compete with the marketing agents, the gurus, the pundits, and experts who are really good in marketing. We compete with them. When COVID happened, it just hit us really badly. We had to take certain steps internally. I&#8217;m very grateful to my team, some of whom have been with me for more than a decade—even predating me in the company—and the team stuck with us, giving me a lot of support to go through those challenges. We learned a lot of things that made us resilient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, when a lot of agencies went out of business, and other businesses as well, we are still here. And if I sum up what made us strong, it was how to market better. Our marketing became our storytelling, and our marketing became way better because COVID forced us to do that. That’s one thing. The second thing we learned is that our lead source used to be leads from partner platforms and organic. The shift was, 90% of the leads came from platforms and 10% from organic. Today, because of COVID, we were able to change the equation to just the opposite—90%, 98% from organic, and almost 1% from any other sources. It taught us a lot of lessons. How about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />So, it was interesting. It was challenging. We were considered essential with what we do, and I give my team credit. Again, I&#8217;ll give my team more credit than you gave yours, how’s that? Without my team—they all had options to work from home, and we had the protocols in place, obviously—but it was odd because there was a paradigm shift. I think we have a lot of brick-and-mortar and online clients, and we deal with a lot of clients that have both. Because brick-and-mortar sales went down, their eCommerce sales just went through the roof, and that opened everyone&#8217;s eyes. They realized, &#8220;Hey, we were able to do this in the store, we need to be able to do that online too.&#8221; And short of coding &#8220;smell-o-vision,&#8221; it was very difficult and challenging for us to be quickly reactive based on the decline of in-store traffic and the increase in online traffic. So, we got through it. It was fun, it was challenging, and it was definitely a learning experience. I think with the whole COVID era of 2020 and 2021, everyone learned, especially with online commerce. Regardless of the platform, I think everyone learned that it’s here to stay. Obviously, you have all these stores still today going out of business, and I believe that’s because online commerce really accelerated during the COVID period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah, true. There has been a big shift in the last, let’s say, 12 months with the advent of AI. I am curious to know—</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />That I fired all my developers? I use ChatGPT for all my code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah. How is that affecting your marketing, your lead flow, the Google changes—GA or Mute—sometimes it&#8217;s there, sometimes it&#8217;s not there, right? And SEO versus GEO, all that AI stuff—how is it affecting your agency?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />So, we use AI as a pretty decent springboard. When we are in charge of content, product descriptions, or whatever the case may be, and we get writer&#8217;s block or creative block—it happens in every agency, right?—we’ll go to ChatGPT or another AI tool and say, &#8220;Okay, write me a description that says this.&#8221; And then it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, alright, now I can get started.&#8221; It’s kind of like a kickstart, but then you have to make sure that it’s not recognized as AI. But we use it as a clutch in an engine. Going back to your race car analogy, we use it just to warm up the engine a little bit. Do you use it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Of course, right. We’ve been using it for idea generation and idea evaluation, in terms of any form of content—idea generation and evaluation. When it comes to creating the meat of it—let’s say we’re talking a blog—we can create the table of contents, figure out and evaluate the ideas, topics, etc., and decide what’s good and what’s bad. Then we start generating the content. Well, initially—I&#8217;m smiling because about a year ago when I started pushing AI to our content writers, it took me about four or five months to change their minds because they were used to writing a certain way. Now here comes the tool. They said, &#8220;No, no, no, no!&#8221; But over time, their attitude changed. Now, today, we use the AI to write the content and then use human expertise to make sure it’s providing unique value and a unique perspective whenever we produce something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />And the right voice. It’s got to be the right tone and the right voice for the company you’re writing for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Exactly. But on the other hand, back in the day—when I say back in the day, let’s say six years ago—Google became stronger, and we had the problem of information overload. Everybody had that problem of information overload. There was a lot of information everywhere, and how do you condense that information? Then comes AI. Now we are able to take a huge amount of information, condense it, and ask, “What’s the expertise or the focus you&#8217;re looking for?” You</p>\n\n\n\n<p>can get the answers you want very fast. Sometimes, down to a three-word answer from a 5,000-word article. That’s amazing. Then we started thinking, &#8220;If we take that analogy, how can we help our customers? Is there a tool that will help us do the same thing for them?&#8221; Our customers are mostly small- to medium-sized businesses—business owners and marketing decision-makers. When it comes to their eCommerce businesses, they’re trying to figure out their strategy, their competitors, understanding their customers&#8217; needs and wants, and how to extrapolate a marketing strategy. Then, they have to figure out feature gaps, conversion gaps, and so on. So, I’ve been in search of a tool, and I recently found one called Inverse Hub. It’s not publicly available yet, but we’ve been lucky to be the initial guinea pigs. We’ve been testing it, and so far, it’s doing a great job for our very solid customers. We are using AI to help our clients understand their competitive landscape, their buyers&#8217; needs and wants based on data, and to understand their strengths and weaknesses. It’s creating strategies, action plans, content calendars, and all of the above. AI accelerates all of that. So, that&#8217;s the angle I&#8217;m very excited about in the last three months. Having that kind of partnership will help us succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />I think it’s interesting with AI because, as a broader picture, it’s still in its infancy. The longer this goes, the more it’s a double-sided coin. It’s there to help, but I’m a little nervous to see what else it’s going to be able to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />I can tell you what it&#8217;s going to do, based on my understanding. It’s going to help us make better, faster, more accurate decisions. That’s the benefit of it. But, it&#8217;s also going to make us dumb. Even though we’re making better, faster, and more accurate decisions, the tool is going to make us dumb. So, those who can stay sharp with the tool, understanding both the positives and negatives, are going to be the ones who win the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Interesting take on that, sir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />So, it’s going to make us not think for ourselves?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Not exactly. But, if we can think <em>with</em> the tool…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Yes, there we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Like with Inverse Hub. I really love that tool—that&#8217;s why I’m saying its name again. Similar tools will emerge in every industry. People who can think using the tool like that are going to be the true winners. But if somebody is going to truly depend upon and rely 100% on the tool itself…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />I got you. I think we both use AI in kind of the same way. It’s interesting that your content writers didn’t want to touch it for a while, because I have three writers, and they looked at me and said, &#8220;Okay, let’s give this a shot.&#8221; I told them, &#8220;You better, because your deadline’s at 5 o’clock today.&#8221; So all of a sudden, it went from hesitation to adoption. I think for us, it may have been a quicker acceptance. But, as tools progress, it gets easier and easier. What was your first IDE that you used, right? Yeah, right after Notepad or Notepad++, and now they have things that will just automatically finish the flow. It’s an interesting time, and everything’s still young.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah. Someone told me last week that something came out in the market called Cursor, I think—code generator using natural language. There&#8217;s a lot of buzz around it now. I don’t know if it’s the talk of the town, but there’s a lot of buzz. I need to take a deep dive into it. I always wonder, and this is one of the positions I have—I always wonder how this will affect platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, and BigCommerce. Let’s say three years from now, would I be able to generate a completely rich-featured eCommerce platform, better than my competition, addressing and understanding the needs of my customers, with all the features built in? What if it knows everything, and all it takes is a few lines of commands to generate it, right? So would that happen? If that happens, what will happen to the platforms?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />I&#8217;ll tell you what would happen, in my opinion. You’d have the dog chasing its tail, hypothetically. If I can upload a photo of a product into some platform, and all of a sudden everything just starts spitting out, my competitor is going to do the same thing. So now it&#8217;s going to come in, and it might really increase the competitiveness of commerce. I think it has the potential to do that. I’m sure it has that potential now. I still want the human touch, because it&#8217;s important. Regardless of whether you say, &#8220;Hey, write this in the tone of so-and-so,&#8221; you still need some human interaction. I think there will always be a need for people with fingers and toes and eyes and ears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah, I totally agree. This goes back to what we discussed a couple of minutes ago: the people who are going to depend upon the tool itself are going to die; they are going to become extinct. But the people who understand the tool, and then bring their human intelligence, are going to be the winners. I totally agree with that. But at the same time, as these tools become more mature, our need to be involved gets lesser and lesser. At some point, how will these platforms affect the game? How will the competitive landscape of the platforms themselves be affected?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />So, AI keeps you up at night, thinking about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah, it does. It does. Nowadays, I’ll tell you, getting older, and when we go to doctors, they’ll start prescribing us medicines. I come back, I put it into ChatGPT, just to make sure, &#8220;How does this react with my history?&#8221; Without my name or any identifiers, I can create avatars and say, &#8220;Hey, this guy, these are the problems, these are the medications. The next doctor—what should I watch for?&#8221; Even with that, it is giving me really good advice. The doctor prevails, of course. I’d say I’m a bit on the riskier side of that, but it’s okay for me because I have this tool, and I have the doctor as well. So I’m not completely AI-based, but before, I didn’t even have that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />We all got our medical degrees from Google, and now we can get them from AI. That’s funny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />I’m curious to know how your company, eCreations, uses AI beyond content generation. What other ways do you use it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />With AI?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />So, content calendar—everything dealing with content, obviously. Or if we get stuck and we’ve got a rogue semicolon somewhere, or this isn&#8217;t working, or this custom extension isn’t working that we&#8217;re making for Woo, ChatGPT will, again, shed light on maybe something we missed. It may give us a snippet of code that makes us say, &#8220;Interesting. Okay, cool.&#8221; So I think it provides us, again, with content, ideas, and answers to quick questions. But it also assists us with maybe a different set of eyes. Like, &#8220;Here’s my code, and I need it to do this,&#8221; or whatever the case may be. Again, just as content writers have content block, sometimes if you’re coding a custom plugin for Woo, or an extension, or whatever, you’re going through your thought process, and you’ve got your systems architecture in place. Everything’s great, planned and dandy, but you forgot a component. We’ve used that for funnels—not only for creation, but verification, and also just double-checking. Like, &#8220;Hey, what else am I forgetting?&#8221; kind of thing. So we use it as another tool to look at something with a different perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />I see. Yeah. I’ll tell you. So, you primarily use it for content and code quality. We started with content, then went into code quality. Nowadays, my QA team is coming up with AI-based tools to increase the effectiveness of the QA itself. They use certain tools like TestRigor, and there’s another one, so they use these tools even beyond automated test tools like Selenium and others. Their life is getting better and easier, and therefore, more effective, using an AI-based QA process. Our UX team uses AI to understand the effectiveness of designs. They identify conversion leaks before they convert the designs into actual pages. We take that, and we’re just beginning to use that tool for ourselves to figure out our competitive landscape and marketing strategies—how to expand. So we started using that internally. Also, someone was telling me yesterday—you know the saying that every 18 months technology doubles in size or increases? Yesterday someone told me that’s now happening every 10 hours. Technology is making changes by many folds every 10 hours. I can see that in my business. The more and more we identify use cases to improve, not only our customer’s lives and their businesses but our own business as well, using AI. I’m very glad to see that it’s coming. And I’m not the only one driving this, pushing this. I used to be the one. Now our team leads are coming to me and the management team saying, &#8220;Why</p>\n\n\n\n<p>can&#8217;t we do this? Can we look into this?&#8221; So it’s exciting. It’s exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />You know what? That’s another good thing here, and I want your input on this. You and I have known each other for many years, and it was good to see Bob again. I saw him in San Diego in—was it 2020?—yeah, it was COVID time. So, I’d like to think that we’re the best in Phoenix, but there are other agencies around. There are agencies like you, Joe, Johnny, and everybody else, and we all get along. We see each other on the WooExperts channel through Automattic. And when we get together, there’s always this tension that I never quite understood. Not between us, but with other agency owners, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Hey, we’re all in the same ocean, we’re all in the same sea,&#8221; but there’s always this competition. I didn’t mean to bring that up earlier, where I’m going to crush you because I like you quite a bit. So, I understand the competitive part of it, and I understand that everyone has their specialty. If someone wants Shopify, I don’t do it, you do. So boom, we’re done. And at the end of the day, the client is at least directed to someone who can help, right? I’m curious to see if you’ve also ever experienced or are experiencing this fight to the death with other agencies, like, &#8220;My job is to get the deal, get the deal, get the deal!&#8221; Are you in that boat, or is it just a Phoenix thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />I would say I have not experienced it. The reason I haven’t experienced it is that I have a couple of guys who watch the Slack space, what’s going on, and then whenever I need something, they tell me, &#8220;You get on it.&#8221; So I am always where they need me most, and I’m there. So, I don’t go into that kind of level to experience that. That’s why you don’t see me much at all in the gatherings, community gatherings, etc. I’m a little busy. If you need me, any agency needs me, I’m there deep. And you have been, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Yes, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />So, it is unfortunate, but I believe it is there. I’m lucky not to experience that, but it is unfortunate that you identified that the ocean is big enough, and it is growing. There are agencies—well, we don’t discriminate against project sizes. We are fascinated. One of the biggest companies in the world came to us—this is in the office equipment business—they came to us, and the first project was $1,500. There was a high-risk merchant who came to us, and the first project was like $3,000. Then, he became a $75,000-per-year customer. He stayed with us, and in three years, that client became a $6 million client. So, this is eCommerce. We don’t discriminate against project size or revenue size. We love the complexity of it. But then there are agencies coming to us saying, &#8220;This is a $20,000 project, help us. We don’t want it,&#8221; or, &#8220;This is a $10,000 project, we don’t want it. Do you want it?&#8221; We take it. So, we operate in more of a collaborative space rather than a competitive one. What I’m trying to say is that kind of mechanism or mechanics is in the marketplace. But the ocean is big enough for us all to survive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Yeah, it’s always interesting finding different agency owners&#8217; perspectives on it. It might be a city thing, because I have a lot of friends like you in different cities, and they’re in a very competitive, bigger city. And it’s like, guys, quantity, quality, or cost—choose two, because you can’t have all three. It’s all about the dollars with these larger organizations that say, &#8220;Hey, I have X number of dollars to spend. I’ve got to spend it by the end of the year. Here’s the scope of work. Can you do it for X?&#8221; And if the answer is no, they just move on. Then I’ll talk to you in six to eight months because you&#8217;re not going to get it delivered. It’s going to be bug-ridden, etc., etc., etc. So, I was curious to get your input on that. And yes, you are a busy person, I’ll give you that, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah, I’m lucky to have a couple of companies, a couple of agencies, that have partnerships with us. Maybe you’re too much out in the open. Maybe everybody’s seeing you as a threat, Steve, because you are a better marketer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Look at me, I’m not a threat!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />They see me as a network geek. &#8220;Oh, he’s a software engineering guy. He’s not a threat. He doesn’t know anything about marketing, that’s fine. He’s not a threat.&#8221; If they see you as a marketing agency guy, you’ve got more marketing muscle under your belt than me. I think that may be the reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Well, I always love talking to you, Gigi. I really do. And I’m glad that we kept in touch since we first met. But enjoy Florida. Take care of yourself, your family, and your team. And with that, I think this was a good conversation. I appreciate you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Yeah, likewise. It has been a wonderful journey so far. I’m glad that we crossed paths about six or seven years ago. It has been a blessing, Steve, and I wish you the best, both personally and professionally. If there’s anything I can do to help, please let me know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />The door’s open here too. So, if you ever get sick of the humidity down in Florida, come out to the heat in Phoenix. Today it’s 103 degrees!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Every day it rains, and it’s crazy humid! We’re going to be about 103 today, too. Yeah, it’s crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve:<br />Alright, my friend. Thank you again. We’ll talk soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi:<br />Alright, thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of<strong><em> Woo AgencyChat</em></strong>, <strong>Gigi J. Kizhakkechethipuzha</strong>, founder of <strong>Virtina</strong>, an eCommerce engineering company, joins <strong>Steve Tamulewicz</strong> from <strong>eCreations</strong>, a WooCommerce and WordPress platform engineering expert. Together, they dive into the all things with running a WooCommerce agency, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how their companies adapted to the shifting landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gigi and Steve share how they approach ecommerce challenges, from competing with marketing agencies to solving complex client problems. The conversation also dives into the increasing role of AI in the industry, discussing both its advantages and potential drawbacks. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Shift to eCommerce During COVID-19</strong>: Both Gigi and Steve shared how their businesses adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Brick-and-mortar stores faced significant challenges, but eCommerce sales surged, highlighting the importance of having a strong online presence. The pandemic forced many companies to improve their digital strategies and embrace eCommerce as a permanent part of their business model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Role of AI in eCommerce</strong>: AI has become a valuable tool for idea generation, content creation, and problem-solving in both companies. Gigi and Steve discussed how they use AI tools like ChatGPT to overcome creative blocks and code challenges, but both emphasized the need for human oversight to ensure the final product aligns with the brand&#8217;s tone and goals. AI is still in its infancy, and while it accelerates processes, companies need to stay sharp and not rely on it exclusively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Collaboration Over Competition</strong>: Gigi emphasizes the importance of collaboration among agencies rather than seeing each other as competitors. He believes the &#8220;ocean is big enough&#8221; for everyone to thrive, and partnerships can lead to better outcomes for clients and businesses alike. Steve shares that some agency environments are highly competitive, but he shares Gigi’s perspective that collaboration is key to long-term success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Adaptability is Key to Growth</strong>: Both guest co-hosts highlight how adaptability has been critical to their success. Whether it&#8217;s shifting lead generation strategies, using new AI tools, or adjusting to market changes, being flexible and open to new technologies and methodologies has allowed them to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving eCommerce space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Future of eCommerce Platforms</strong>: Gigi raises an interesting point about the future of platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, and BigCommerce, wondering if AI will one day generate fully-featured eCommerce platforms based on customer needs.

This helps in verifying and maintaining users&#8217; online presence and plays a significant role in keeping sensitive information safe from unauthorized access, which is mandated by privacy laws and regulations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we’ll discuss the complexities of securing online identities and guide you through the essentials of digital identity management. We’ll also show you how easy it is to start with <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> – a user-friendly platform that simplifies managing online identities for individuals and organizations, ensuring security and ease of use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding digital identity management and access management</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One common mistake companies make is to confuse digital identity management with access management. In reality, the two concepts are related but not quite the same, and it’s important to know the differences between them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital identity management involves the creation, management, and retirement of online identities. It&#8217;s the electronic footprint that represents an individual within a system, critical for identifying and authenticating users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might include assigning each employee a unique identifier (like an email address) upon joining. This identifier is used to create profiles in the company&#8217;s systems, granting access to relevant applications and data based on their role. As employees move within the company, their access rights are updated or revoked accordingly, ensuring security and compliance. The process also includes authentication methods, such as passwords or biometrics, to verify identities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Access management focuses on regulating what resources a user can access within a system. It&#8217;s about setting and enforcing rules and policies linked to an individual&#8217;s online identity and determining their permissions within an organization&#8217;s digital space.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two other important terms you’ll often come across in this space are Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Privileged Access Management (PAM). IAM covers the broad spectrum of managing user identities and their access rights, ensuring everyone has the appropriate entry to resources. PAM, however, narrows this focus to the high-stakes world of privileged accounts, those with the keys to the kingdom – meaning they have permissions to manage and secure access to critical systems and data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An effective digital identity management system is the foundation for solid access management. For instance, integrating a solution like <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> can simplify the intricacies involved in both areas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar is a tool that allows users to create digital identities linked to their email addresses, and you can connect your website to Gravatar’s API to import relevant user data when that user signs up to your website. This allows you to utilize Gravatar as your digital identity verification system, allowing you to set relevant access rights for your users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding attributes of digital identities</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Identifiers, attributes, and credentials are the foundation of digital identities, each playing an important role in online identity management. Let’s look at them in more detail:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Identifiers</strong>, such as usernames or email addresses, act as the entry point, linking each digital identity to a unique online presence. Gravatar, for example, uses email addresses as a universal identifier to create a globally recognized profile.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Attributes</strong>, the personal details associated with an identifier, range from names to contact information, painting a fuller picture of the identity. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Credentials</strong> include passwords, biometric data, or security tokens. They serve as the key to authenticating and validating an individual&#8217;s claim to identity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping these details accurate and safe is crucial. If things go wrong, someone could steal an identity, get into places they shouldn’t, or even cause data leaks. That&#8217;s why companies use advanced systems to protect this information and follow strict rules to guard privacy and safety.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Typical process of digital identity management</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Provisioning and granting access</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You start by setting up the different digital identities and user accounts across platforms. This can vary from one organization to another, but the process is more or less like this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>User registration: </strong>Enter basic details like name, email, and password.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Verification:</strong> Confirm the email or phone via a sent link or code.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Set up an additional verification step for login (more on that in the next step). </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Acceptance of terms: </strong>Agree to the terms of service and privacy policy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Profile completion: </strong>Fill in additional personal or professional info.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Permissions for new users are set following guidelines from standards such as <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/standard/27001\" rel=\"nofollow\">ISO/IEC 27001</a>, ensuring secure access control from the start. This approach ensures that access levels are appropriately assigned according to the user&#8217;s role within the organization, laying a foundational layer of security. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Authentication</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Authentication is mandatory, and it can be done in many different ways. From traditional passwords to Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and biometrics, each method strengthens security in its unique way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, managing multiple authentication methods across different platforms presents several challenges. It can lead to confusion among users who must remember various passwords and authentication steps, increasing the risk of password fatigue and security breaches.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For administrators, it complicates security protocols, requiring extensive resources to monitor and update these systems to ensure they remain secure and user-friendly. Additionally, integrating and maintaining compatibility across diverse platforms can be technically challenging and time-consuming, straining IT departments and potentially leading to gaps in security coverage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Authorization</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Authorization is what dictates the actions that authenticated users are permitted to perform. This process, distinct from authentication, involves assigning specific roles and permissions, a task that grows increasingly complex across different systems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are different ways of doing this:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): </strong>Assign access levels based on user roles (e.g., admin, editor).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): </strong>Grant permissions based on attributes (e.g., department).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Manual configuration: </strong>Admins manually set specific access rights as needed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Default permissions: </strong>New accounts get basic access which can be adjusted later.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Self-service permissions: </strong>Users can request more access, pending admin approval.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Lifecycle management</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The nature of digital identities requires continuous management throughout their lifecycle, from activation to eventual deactivation. The challenge here lies in ensuring these identities are accurately maintained and updated across numerous platforms. For example, companies need to make sure that ex-employees have zero access to important data such as accounts, documents, and passwords because they can take advantage of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this properly, businesses need to implement a systematic approach to manage these changes effectively and securely, preventing potential security vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Federation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A federation is a set of agreements and standards that enable using a single identity across multiple systems. With technologies like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Identity Providers (IdPs), users enjoy the convenience of accessing multiple services with one set of credentials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar is a great example of this federated approach, allowing a single, consistent identity to be recognized and utilized across various services, thereby simplifying the user experience and enhancing security.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Auditing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Auditing is integral to ensuring that digital identity management processes remain compliant and secure. This involves comprehensive logging and monitoring, which can be a complex task for organizations with extensive digital footprints.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Effective auditing practices are crucial for detecting security breaches and ensuring adherence to regulatory standards, forming a backbone for secure digital identity management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Gravatar facilitates digital identity management for website owners&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gravatar-homepage-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar homepage\" class=\"wp-image-1636\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> is a digital identity management solution for a wide range of online platforms, including websites, web applications, forums, eCommerce stores, and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It offers users the ability to create a digital identity linked to their email address, enabling this identity to be consistently recognized across any platform that integrates Gravatar&#8217;s services.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gravatar-profile-example.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar profile example \n\" class=\"wp-image-1634\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially what this means is that when someone signs up to your website, the information you get from them comes directly from their Gravatar profile. This simplifies digital identity management for you as a website owner as Gravatar handles the storage and management of all user data, alleviating administrative burden and compliance hurdles for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many benefits to using Gravatar:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Users carry their digital identity all over the web</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar stands out by providing what&#8217;s known as a “universal avatar”, a singular digital identity that moves with the user from one site to another. This universal recognition creates a streamlined online experience and means that you, as a website owner, can count on the accuracy and consistency of that user data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Users don’t fill in data multiple times</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most tangible benefits of Gravatar is the fact that users no longer need to fill in their details on every new site they visit; instead, their Gravatar profile carries their information across the web. This feature not only makes online navigation more efficient for users but also contributes to higher engagement rates on websites, as the barrier to participation is markedly lowered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Data storage and management are handled by Gravatar</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar&#8217;s role in handling data storage and management can be very beneficial for website owners and businesses. The platform securely stores user information and avatars, taking on the responsibility of managing this data, which can be a complex and security-sensitive task.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This offloads a considerable workload from organizations that might not have the resources or expertise to manage user data securely. Additionally, Gravatar’s adherence to data protection standards, including the <a href=\"https://gdpr-info.eu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR)</a> and the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\" rel=\"nofollow\">California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA)</a>, ensures website owners comply with important privacy regulations, further reducing legal and operational risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>You can create personalized experiences with user data</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its centralized approach to data management, Gravatar prioritizes user privacy, ensuring that site owners can only access the information that users have agreed to share. This arrangement supports the creation of personalized experiences on websites without compromising user privacy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Website owners can tailor content, recommendations, and services to individual users based on the data available through Gravatar, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Improve your digital identity strategy with Gravatar&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the growing amount of information stored online and the rise of cyber attacks, it’s becoming increasingly important for businesses to take digital identity management seriously, especially if they want to protect user data and streamline user experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adopting a third-party authentication service like <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> can greatly simplify this process and help you efficiently handle the intricacies of digital identity management.&nbsp;Gravatar offers a secure, user-friendly platform that bridges the gap between privacy concerns and the desire for a fluid online experience.

Everything is stored securely with Gravatar, so developers can benefit from our API and SDKs without worrying about regulations and handling customer information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Include a welcome screen with a microsurvey</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A welcome screen with a quick survey (also known as a microsurvey) is a great way to start your users&#8217; journey. It&#8217;s like greeting new users and asking about their preferences, which makes them feel more valued, helps personalize the experience, and gives you insights to improve your product.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how you can make your microsurvey more effective:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keep it simple, don&#8217;t overwhelm users.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ask relevant questions so you can focus on improving user experience.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tell users how their answers help.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For multiple questions, indicate how many are left.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duolingo</a> asks users which language they want to learn and why, personalizing the learning experience from the start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1323\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/duoling-startup-screen.png\" alt=\"Duolingo startup screen\" class=\"wp-image-2137\" />\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1269\" height=\"784\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/duolingo-micro-survey-1.png\" alt=\"Duolingo micro survey\" class=\"wp-image-2138\" />\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pre-gathering user data with Gravatar</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar can enhance your welcome process by auto-filling information with existing Gravatar profile data. Then, it can use the same data to personalize the welcome screen by showing the user&#8217;s profile picture and asking smarter questions instead of generic queries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating Gravatar can make your onboarding faster and more personal. Here&#8217;s how:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/\">Gravatar&#8217;s API</a> to fetch user data based on the <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/general/hash/\">user email hashes</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/api/avatars/\">Avatar API</a> to display the user&#8217;s Gravatar image on the welcome screen.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pre-fill any available information in your micro survey.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tailor your questions based on the data you already have.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Combining a thoughtful welcome screen, a brief microsurvey, and Gravatar integration creates a smooth, personalized start to the user&#8217;s journey with your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Segment your users based on goals</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dividing your users into groups based on what they want to achieve can make your onboarding process more effective. This approach helps you give each user the most relevant information and guidance, which is very likely to increase engagement and improve future adoption rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How to segment users:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Use surveys or welcome messages</strong> to ask about their main objectives, such as &#8220;<em>What do you want to achieve with our product?</em>&#8220;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Group users with similar goals together.</strong> For instance, in a project management tool, you might have groups for personal use, small business, and enterprise users.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Design different onboarding flows for each user group</strong> and show features and tips most relevant to each group&#8217;s goals.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Choose onboarding and UI elements that work best for each group&#8217;s needs.</strong> For example, use tooltips for tech-savvy users and guided tours for beginners.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Real-world example:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.videoask.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VideoAsk</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"2069\" height=\"1040\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/videoask-onboarding.png\" alt=\"Videoask startup screen\" class=\"wp-image-2141\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.videoask.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VideoAsk</a>, a video survey platform, segments new users by asking them if they want to recruit talent or conduct research to understand their audience better. Then, based on the answer, it shows different features and tutorials. This approach ensures each user sees the most relevant parts of the product first.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to regularly review and update your segments as you learn more about your users and how they use your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Utilize essential UX patterns&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing your onboarding experience, you must use the right UX patterns to guide users effectively. These patterns help users quickly understand your product and its value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, <strong>interactive walkthroughs and product tours</strong> are excellent ways to introduce new users to your product&#8217;s key features. They provide a virtual guide, reducing friction and improving understanding. When creating these, keep them concise and focused on core features. Use progress indicators to set expectations, and always allow users to exit or skip if they prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An excellent example of this is the onboarding process of <a href=\"https://asana.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asana</a>, which allows new users to customize their projects from the get-go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/asana-onboarding-example.gif?w=660\" alt=\"Asana onboarding process\" class=\"wp-image-2142\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Tooltips and hotspots are another way of providing contextual guidance as users explore your interface. They draw attention to specific elements and explain functionality without disrupting the user&#8217;s workflow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/asana-tooltips.png?w=660\" alt=\"Tooltips with Asana\" class=\"wp-image-2143\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When using tooltips, <strong>keep the copy clear and actionable</strong>. Use them sparingly to avoid overwhelming users, and make sure they&#8217;re easy to dismiss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we have onboarding checklists and progress bars. These are effective tools for breaking down key setup tasks into manageable steps. They motivate users by gamifying the experience and providing a sense of accomplishment. When creating checklists, prioritize 3-5 key actions that deliver immediate value. <strong>Use clear, action-oriented microcopy, and celebrate when users complete all steps.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you need to add a resource center where users can self-serve their education and resolve issues independently, significantly reducing support costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"466\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gravatar-support-center.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar support center\" class=\"wp-image-2144\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When setting up a resource center, organize content by topic and format. Make search functionality prominent and gather feedback to identify content gaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the goal of these UX patterns is to help users understand and derive value from your product as quickly as possible. Each pattern serves a specific purpose, so choose the ones that best fit your product and user needs. Regularly test and refine these elements based on user feedback and behavior to continually improve your onboarding experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ensure onboarding highlights value</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing your onboarding process, focus on demonstrating how your product solves users&#8217; problems and improves their lives. This approach helps users quickly realize the benefits of your product, increasing the likelihood they&#8217;ll continue using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One key strategy is to guide users to their &#8220;Aha!&#8221; moment as quickly as possible. This is the point where they truly grasp the value of your product. To achieve this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Keep your onboarding process concise and focused on core benefits.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use demo data or templates to help users visualize the product&#8217;s potential.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Highlight key features that deliver immediate value.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.canva.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canva</a>, a graphic design platform, immediately shows users a gallery of templates they can use. This instantly demonstrates the product&#8217;s value by showing how easily users can create professional designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"348\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/canva-homepage-1.png?w=660\" alt=\"Canva homepage\" class=\"wp-image-2145\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to facilitate setup and help users achieve quick payoffs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s face it: <strong>nobody likes a complicated setup process</strong>. The quicker users can get started and see results, the more likely they are to stick around. So, how do we make this happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, let&#8217;s talk about making setup a breeze:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Use AI and machine learning to help guide users through setup based on their needs.</strong> For instance, <a href=\"https://www.intercom.com/blog/announcing-resolution-bot/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intercom&#8217;s Resolution Bot</a> learns from past conversations to answer user questions during setup. Or consider <a href=\"https://www.appcues.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Appcues</a>, which uses AI to suggest the best onboarding flow based on user behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/democues-app-demo.png?w=660\" alt=\"Democues app demo\" class=\"wp-image-2146\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Show, don&#8217;t just tell, with interactive walkthroughs that guide users step-by-step</strong>. Tools like <a href=\"https://www.walkme.com/\">WalkMe</a> or <a href=\"https://www.pendo.io/\">Pendo</a> can create custom guides that adapt to each user&#8217;s progress.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"323\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/pendo-onboarding-tool.png?w=660\" alt=\"Pendo onboarding tool dashboard with tooltips\" class=\"wp-image-2148\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Do some of the work for users by pre-filing information where possible</strong>. Less typing for users means less frustration.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Want to make the setup more fun? </strong>Try adding some game-like elements. Progress bars or achievement badges can turn a boring setup into a mini-adventure.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, but how can you create those quick payoffs? The answer is simple: don&#8217;t make users guess why your product is great – show them! During onboarding, focus on showcasing immediate benefits. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you have a project management tool, show how it can organize tasks in just a few clicks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For a fitness app, demonstrate how quickly users can set up a workout plan.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is to connect your product&#8217;s features directly to the user&#8217;s needs or problems. Say something like, &#8220;<em>See how easy it is to track your team&#8217;s progress?</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>Look at that – you&#8217;ve just planned your whole week&#8217;s meals in under 5 minutes!</em>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Give users some easy victories right off the bat. These quick wins should be simple tasks that pack a punch in showing your product&#8217;s value. For instance, in a photo editing app, you can let users apply a one-click filter that dramatically improves their photo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, use what you know about your users to point them toward features they&#8217;ll love. This could be based on info they provided during sign-up or actions they&#8217;ve taken in the app. For example, if a user said they&#8217;re interested in running, a fitness app could highlight its running tracking features first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These personalized touches make users feel understood and help them get more out of your product faster. For more information, check out our guide on user experience personalization.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Drive users toward key actions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Guiding users to perform key actions is crucial for ensuring they get the most value from your product quickly. These actions are the core activities that demonstrate your product&#8217;s usefulness and encourage continued engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To effectively drive users toward key actions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Identify your product&#8217;s most important features or tasks.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Design clear, action-oriented onboarding flows.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use prominent Calls-To-Action (CTAs) to guide users.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider using gamification elements like progress bars or achievements to motivate users. For example, LinkedIn encourages profile completion by showing a progress meter and suggesting the next steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personalization can make your guidance more effective. Use data from the sign-up process or initial interactions to tailor the key actions you suggest to each user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While guiding users is important, you also have to provide options for more exploratory or experienced users. Include easily accessible &#8220;<em>skip</em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>learn more</em>&#8221; options in your onboarding flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to measure the completion rate of these key actions. This data can help you refine your onboarding process and identify any stumbling blocks users might be encountering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By focusing on driving users toward key actions, you help them experience your product&#8217;s value quickly, increasing the likelihood of long-term engagement and success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to measure and optimize user onboarding</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure your onboarding process is effective, you need to measure its performance and continuously optimize it. This involves tracking specific metrics and collecting user feedback. Let&#8217;s explore the key metrics to track and how to collect valuable data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Key metrics to track</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Time to Value (TTV):</strong> This measures how quickly users experience the core value of your product. A shorter TTV often leads to better user retention. To measure TTV, track the time from sign-up to when users complete key actions that represent value realization.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Engagement rate:</strong> This metric shows the percentage of users actively using your product after onboarding. A high engagement rate indicates a successful onboarding strategy. Analyze user activity logs to determine the proportion of active users over time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Customer churn:</strong> Churn rate measures how many users stop using your product after onboarding. A high churn rate may indicate problems with your onboarding process. Calculate the percentage of users who discontinue use within a defined period post-onboarding.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Feature adoption rate:</strong> This tracks how many users engage with key features of your product. It helps you understand which features are being utilized and which may need better onboarding support. Monitor user interactions with specific features to calculate the adoption rate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>User satisfaction:</strong> This qualitative metric provides insights into users&#8217; experiences and areas for improvement. Use surveys, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores post-onboarding to gauge user satisfaction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to collect data</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To gather the necessary data for these metrics, consider the following methods:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Analytics tools: </strong>Use platforms like <a href=\"https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Analytics</a>, <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mixpanel</a>, or <a href=\"https://amplitude.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amplitude</a> to track user behavior. Set up event tracking to monitor key actions during onboarding. Analyze funnel reports to understand where users are dropping off and which steps are most effective.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"291\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mixpanel-homepage.png?w=660\" alt=\"Mixpanel homepage and example analytics board\" class=\"wp-image-2149\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Customer feedback:</strong> Conduct surveys using tools like <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SurveyMonkey</a> or <a href=\"https://www.typeform.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Typeform</a> to gather user opinions on the onboarding experience. Implement NPS and CSAT surveys to measure overall satisfaction. Use in-app feedback tools to collect real-time insights from users.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"322\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/survey-monkey-homepage.png?w=660\" alt=\"Survey Monkey homepage\" class=\"wp-image-2150\" />\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>User interviews:</strong> Conduct one-on-one interviews with a diverse sample of users. These provide deeper insights into the onboarding experience and can uncover issues that might not be apparent from quantitative data alone.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Heatmaps and session recordings: </strong>Tools like <a href=\"https://www.hotjar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hotjar</a> or <a href=\"https://www.crazyegg.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crazy Egg</a> can help you visualize how users interact with your onboarding process. Analyze these to identify areas where users struggle or spend more time than expected.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img tabindex=\"0\" width=\"660\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hotjar-homepage.png?w=660\" alt=\"Hotjar homepage\" class=\"wp-image-2151\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the goal of collecting this data is to continually improve your onboarding process. Regularly review your metrics and user feedback to identify areas for optimization. Look for patterns in user behavior and feedback that suggest where improvements can be made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you notice a high drop-off rate at a particular step in your onboarding process, investigate why users might be struggling at that point. Are the instructions unclear? Is the step too complex? Use this insight to refine and simplify that part of the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Integrate Gravatar to improve your onboarding experience</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we&#8217;ve covered a lot about making your onboarding process better.

This was announced by the Automattic-sponsored developer Dion Hulse.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mandatory Two-Factor Authentication</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beginning next month, WordPress.org will make two-factor authentication (2FA) mandatory for all plugin and theme authors. Authors can configure 2FA by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/me/profile/security.\">visiting their WordPress.org profiles</a>, and the platform has already started prompting them to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dion Hulse emphasized the importance of securely storing backup codes, as losing access to both 2FA methods and backup codes could complicate account recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SVN Passwords for Commit Access</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.org will also introduce SVN passwords for committing changes to plugins and themes. This feature separates commit access from the main WordPress.org account credentials, offering an extra layer of security. Authors can generate SVN passwords through their profiles, ensuring that their main account passwords are protected. Those using deployment scripts, like GitHub Actions, will need to update their stored passwords with these new SVN credentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those wondering why the Plugin Review Team is not using 2FA with SVN, Dion explained, “Due to technical limitations, 2FA cannot be applied to our existing code repositories, that’s why we’ve chosen to secure WordPress.org code through a combination of account-level two-factor authentication, high-entropy SVN passwords, and other deploy-time security features (such as &nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/release-confirmation-emails/\">Release Confirmations</a>).”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information, authors can refer to the guides on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/handbook/tutorials-guides/configuring-two-factor-authentication/\">Configuring Two-Factor Authentication</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/handbook/tutorials-guides/svn-access/\">Subversion Access</a> and Chris Christoff’s post on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2024/06/26/keeping-your-plugin-committer-accounts-secure/\">Keeping Your Plugin Committer Accounts Secure</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Community Reaction&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The community has reacted positively to these changes, with some expressing that these updates were long overdue. “At least we were earlier than someone stepping on Mars, &#8221; joked developer Toma Todua.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, the WordPress Plugin Team has ramped up efforts to enhance platform security. In June, they temporarily halted plugin releases and forced all plugin authors to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2024/06/29/password-reset-required-for-plugin-authors/\">reset their passwords</a> after five WordPress.org user accounts were compromised.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Sep 2024 20:12:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: Key Insights From WooCommerce Survey 2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=161147\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://wptavern.com/key-insights-from-woocommerce-survey-2024\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3340:\"<p>WooCommerce has unveiled the results of its <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/black-friday-trends/\">2024 summer survey</a>, shedding light on how store owners, developers, and partners gear up for Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) and the holiday shopping rush.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the key takeaways from the survey:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>BFCM Sales Account for a Major Share of Annual Revenue</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>BFCM plays a crucial role for online merchants, contributing to approximately 30%-50% of their yearly sales. The survey revealed that 66% of stores reported increased sales during the holiday season, highlighting its significance for businesses. In fact, for some stores, up to 50% of their annual revenue comes from this period alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>46% of stores see up to 30% of their yearly sales during this time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>26% generate over 30% of their annual sales.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>8% surpass 50% of annual sales during BFCM.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stores &amp; Early Planning</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Larger stores with annual revenues of $250K+ are 12% more likely to begin preparations early. In total, <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/black-friday-trends/\">81% of stores actively plan</a> for BFCM promotions.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>26% of stores begin planning 1-4 weeks before BFCM.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>27% start preparations 1-3 months ahead.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>13% dedicate 3-6 months to preparation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4% start more than 6 months in advance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Preparation Tactics &amp; Strategies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>26% of stores planned to increase inventory as their primary preparation strategy. This was followed by marketing, promotions, and website optimization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to marketing channels:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>29% of stores find email the most effective, followed by organic social media (25%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Other popular channels include paid social (13%), search ads (8%), and content marketing (6%).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For the 2024 holiday season, 34% of stores are adjusting their strategies, focusing on: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Introducing new products (26%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improving marketing efforts (24%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enhancing website performance (16%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Starting sales early (10%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offering special discounts (9%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Making changes to customer engagement, social media, and inventory management completes the list.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Multi-Channel Sales </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey also noted that 67% of stores sell through multiple channels, including physical locations and online marketplaces. Specifically, 11% of stores sell on Amazon, 8% sell on Etsy and 6% sell on eBay.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Customer Engagement &amp; Analytics</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A significant 91% of stores use analytics tools like Google Analytics, WooCommerce Analytics Dashboard, and Meteorik to evaluate campaign performance.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast, which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, enhancing WordPress learning experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice. Or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Jonathan Bossenger. Jonathan based in Cape town, South Africa, has been an integral part of the WordPress community for nearly a decade. Transitioning from software development to web, and then WordPress development, he found his passion in education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since attending his first word camp in 2015, he has focused on creating educational content for WordPress developers. Now employed at Automattic as a developer educator, he contributes to the Learn platform, helping to train and guide new developers in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s on the podcast today to explain some of the ways that you can learn WordPress with up to date, freely available content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the goal of making WordPress learning accessible globally, especially for those who can&#8217;t afford expensive courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion gets into the transformative potential of the Learn WordPress platform, especially in the era of Playground, which will enable interactive coding practice without the need for external tools. Jonathan sees this as a game changer for web agencies, providing a streamlined training resource for new developers and conserving valuable time and resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cover Jonathan&#8217;s journey from software developer to developer educator, supported by his former employer, Castos. He shares the challenges of keeping educational content current amidst WordPress&#8217;s rapid evolution, and the importance of staying updated with WordPress core developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation also touches on the structured learning pathways, designed to guide learners from beginner to advanced levels. Segmented into user designer and developer categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The professionalism of WordPress projects like Learn, and the essential role of contributors in translating and internationalising content to reach a broader audience ,comes under the microscope as well. And Jonathan reflects upon the dynamic nature of open source communities, stressing the need for decisive leadership in software development decisions from time to time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we talk about the many ways that you can assist the Learn project, and there are many more ways than you might imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how people learn about WordPress, and how you can be a part of that project, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Jonathan Bossenger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today, once more by Jonathan Bossenger. Hey, Jonathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:59] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Hello, I&#8217;m back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much for coming on the podcast today. We&#8217;re going to be talking about a really important subject, and a subject which I think is getting more importance. We can get into the politics or what have you of that in a moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we begin the conversation all about Learn, and what&#8217;s going on over there, Jonathan, for those people who don&#8217;t know who you are, do you want to just give us your brief potted history? Maybe your current job, and your history with WordPress and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:24] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Sure. So for those who don&#8217;t know, my name is Jonathan Bossenger. I live in Cape Town in South Africa, which is the country right at the tip of Africa. I have been involved in the WordPress community now for about nine years. I went to my first WordCamp in Cape Town in 2015, and I am a web developer, originally a software developer, then a web developer, then a WordPress developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m now transitioned to this wonderful new thing that I call, or at least people call developer educator. I&#8217;m currently employed at Automattic, I&#8217;m sponsored to work full-time with the WordPress training team, and my job is basically creating educational content for WordPress developers. So everything that is on Learn, that has to do with WordPress development, I have got some hand in somewhere there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Was this a pivot that you kind of had as part of your north star five or six years ago, or is this very much an evolution that kind of happened to you without it meaning to be the case?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:16] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> I did pivot from software development to developer education kind of organically, but also with a little bit of support. You&#8217;ll appreciate the story, Nathan. So as you will know, I was working at Castos for a number of years. I was the initial developer that Craig hired when we first kicked Castos off. I became lead developer as the company grew.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in conversations that I had with Craig, as my CEO, as the company grew, and as we run about the time the TinySeed thing happened and Craig had some money that he could spend to grow the team and all those things. He sat me down and he said to me, right, what does the future look like for you? As the company grows, we&#8217;ve got potential to get big, what does the future look like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he said the word engineering manager, and the term CTO came up, and I realised in those conversations that that was not what I wanted to be doing. As much as I enjoyed developing software, I&#8217;m not great at leading people. I have a very short temper, I struggle to lead properly, and part of it is also just I&#8217;ve never had good experience under other good leaders, and that was part of my journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what I really do enjoy doing, and you&#8217;ll appreciate this, I enjoy educating folks about content, about things, about GPL, about whatever. And I really enjoy teaching other developers, mentoring them, guiding them through a journey. And at the time I shared this information with Craig, he said to me, well, funnily enough there&#8217;s this role at Delicious Brains. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll know Delicious Brains, WP Migrate, and all those plugins. And they were looking for specifically a developer educator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I sat on that job posting for about a year and a half before I eventually applied. But that was the sort of transition of that process, going from full-time software developer to developer educator. And that process is what landed me up where I am today because I enjoy teaching WordPress, I enjoy teaching WordPress development. I discovered the training team through a series of events. And so when the role, when the position became available to do this full time, I grabbed it with both hands, and that&#8217;s where I am now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you are an Automattician, you work for Automattic now, yeah. And you are a hundred percent on creating educational materials, that is all that you are involved in?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:13] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> That is what my role is within the company, but I also do jump in here and there all over the place because I am a full-time volunteer, if you will, I&#8217;m a lifelong volunteer. So I do try and get involved with Core wherever I can. I try and help with the docs wherever I can because the docs, especially the developer docs, they inform a lot of my content that we create for Learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I find issues in the docs, I&#8217;ll try and update those. After about a year and a half of pestering folks, eventually they gave me access to the docs, and I can just make whatever changes I need to. And I do treat that with a lot of respect, and I only make changes that I think are really obvious. Or I check with folks first and make sure that those changes make sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my employment at Automattic is specifically to work with the training team, to help drive the Learn WordPress platform forward, primarily creating content, helping with the platform, helping with the code base. Bringing in other collaborators, working with other collaborators, supporting them, and just helping to make Learn WordPress the best place to learn about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, nice. I guess if you have the calling to be an educator, and some people do and some people don&#8217;t, I know plenty of people who really enjoy the work that they do as educators, be it of children, online, or what have you. If you have that calling, it is profoundly meaningful, isn&#8217;t it? If you have that in you, that you wish to educate other people, I think there&#8217;s a deep sense of satisfaction and meaning that comes from that, and significance that comes from that. So I hope it&#8217;s fulfilling you on that level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, interesting in the bit that you just said, you&#8217;re dipping in and out. Because I guess, if you are going to be teaching people about WordPress, and given what Learn covers, and we&#8217;ll get into all of that, you can&#8217;t become de-skilled, can you? It&#8217;s not like you could sit making courses five years from now, without being absolutely knee deep in the weeds of the project as a whole, because won&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. You won&#8217;t know what to make courses about. You won&#8217;t understand the new UI that&#8217;s coming down the pike, and all of that kind of thing. So I guess the two things go hand in hand, you have to keep up to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:05] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Absolutely. I have learned more about WordPress Core in the last two years that I&#8217;ve been teaching it, than I ever have in the nine years before that I was using it and building on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s that very common saying about, to really understand a topic, teach it. Because you can only teach someone something if you really understand. And so I am challenged even with some of the older stuff. I was doing a series of lessons recently about how to extend user capabilities, and I went down a massive rabbit hole about how this all actually works. I&#8217;ve used it in the past as a plugin developer when I was working at Castos, and for projects and whatever. I&#8217;ve assigned capabilities, I&#8217;ve created custom capabilities, but I&#8217;ve never understood how they really just work. I&#8217;ve just gone, yeah, they work, and I&#8217;ve moved on with my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I have to understand deeply how they work, before I can teach somebody. So this is the interesting thing about WordPress is there is so much to learn. There is so much historical information, there is so much in Core that will continue forever, that there is to learn. And then as you say, there&#8217;s so much new stuff coming in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new stuff is a whole topic on its own, and we&#8217;ll definitely chat about that in a second. But yeah, there&#8217;s just so much to learn and to then teach that I feel like, I&#8217;ve always said I&#8217;ve never been the best developer, there are folks out there who are way better developers than I am, there are architects and whatever else. But I&#8217;ve always had this desire to share knowledge and teach others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I get the best of both worlds. I get to dive into Core, I get to dig into the code, I get to understand how it works. I get to find bugs and report them if something&#8217;s wonky while I&#8217;m preparing a lesson. And then I get to share that with others, and help them figure out how this stuff all works, I do all the fumbling, and then I present the lesson, and off they go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> With the kind of teaching that you do, so I have several friends in the real world who live close to me who teach children in schools. And the feedback there is immediate, you teach the content, and then you&#8217;re either staring a bunch of happy faces, or there&#8217;s confusion on the face, and so you realise, okay, I pitched that incorrectly. The whole online content thing, I don&#8217;t understand how the feedback works there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, we spoke about it being a meaningful thing, and I think probably if you&#8217;re a classroom teacher, the meaning is the faces. You know, you see the impression that you are having on the children. You can see that, okay, that child who didn&#8217;t get that yesterday now gets it, and there&#8217;s that it immediate feedback loop, which must be beautiful. But what does that look like for online content? How do you even get feedback about, okay, that worked, or that was good, or no, redo that? How does that happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:26] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> There&#8217;s a couple of ways that does happen for me at least. The one way is that we have got feedback processes in our content on Learn WordPress. So there is a feedback form linked at the bottom of most lessons. The end of every course we&#8217;re implementing a feedback survey. But we also do things that allow more direct feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So something that we kicked off last year for the first time, we ran one last year, we are planning on running two this year, we just finished the first one, was this concept of a in-person course cohort. So we take a series of content, and then we invite learners to come along on a journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s asynchronous communication, but then we, once a week we have a synchronous call where everybody who&#8217;s available gets together, and we chat through the content. And in those spaces I get to interact with the students directly. I get to see the successes. I get to see the difficulties and try and help them with the difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also get to see the students, or the learners, helping each other out. And so in all of those spaces I get that sort of reinforce, okay, wow, this is working, this isn&#8217;t working, seeing this successful, that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then also, interestingly, with the way we create content, we have a review process. So when a new lesson is ready to be published, we will upload it to the GitHub issue, we manage everything in GitHub. We&#8217;ll upload it to the GitHub issue, and then we will ask members of the training team to review the content. And so they&#8217;re basically getting like a preview of the content before it gets published live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a lot of the folks who do the reviews are subject matter experts in that area. So if it&#8217;s a thing about developing a plugin, or developing a block, or whatever. It&#8217;ll be block developers, and plugin developers, and theme developers who review the content. And they will give you direct feedback as well. And they will say, oh, this works, ooh, I learned this today. And so you&#8217;ll get those little nuggets here and there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have a lot of great feedback. I&#8217;d love to get more, and we&#8217;re working on processes to get more, and more, and more feedback. Because the more interactions we can have with learners, the more we can see what works and what doesn&#8217;t. And that&#8217;s definitely a big part of the whole redesign, and the relaunch that we&#8217;ve been working on, is creating spaces for that feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice. Let&#8217;s get into the content itself. So it occurs to me that we&#8217;ve got this far into the episode and we haven&#8217;t actually mentioned the URL, which is a bit remiss. So head to learn.wordpress.org, and from there you can go in all sorts of directions, and you&#8217;ll be able to see that. The UI may change, it has undergone some changes recently as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in an ideal world, we&#8217;d go to that website, and we would have any question about WordPress, and we would find the answer. That would be a utopia, some sort of crazy universe that we don&#8217;t live in, where everything that we could possibly want, there&#8217;s a piece of content which will address that question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, that&#8217;s not the reality. You have to pick and choose your subjects. At this moment in history, we&#8217;re in July 2024, how are those decisions made? How do you make the decision, okay, this is the next tranche of content that we&#8217;re going to make? Ignore what you&#8217;ve already got. How are you making decisions about what comes next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:12] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> So that is very much driven by the learners themselves. And you mentioned about ignore the content you&#8217;ve got, but the content that we&#8217;ve got is actually very important to think about because it informed where we are currently. So at the end of, I think it was the end of 2021, or 2022, I can&#8217;t remember exactly what year, but the training team, so the WordPress training team, these are the folks that are similar to the Core team, or the Meta team, we all know those teams in Slack, and all the different teams on the Make Blogs. The training team is the team that focuses on everything on Learn WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They did a individual learner feedback survey. They tried to reach all folks who have accessed Learn content since its inception in 2020. And they said, give us your feedback. What is working, what is not working? And the biggest piece of feedback we got out of that learner survey was more structured learning pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that stage, the content was very scattershot. We were creating the content that we thought was good, so when I joined Automattic as a full-time sponsored contributor, and I looked at the developer focused content there, I went, well, there&#8217;s nothing about WordPress hooks. That&#8217;s probably one of the first things that you need to learn about if you&#8217;re going to develop with WordPress. So I created a series of lessons on WordPress hooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I went, well, what is the next thing I want to create? There was no structure, there was no plan. And so learning pathways became the thing that folks wanted the most. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re focusing on right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Could you just clear up what pathways means? Because I suspect it might be a word which isn&#8217;t entirely familiar to everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:37] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> A hundred percent. And I didn&#8217;t know what a learning pathway was before I got started, to be honest. But in our scope, in our space, when we talk about a learning pathway, we mean a specifically structured series of modules and lessons that take you from point 1 to point 5, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We defined a series of learning pathways, the first are all user focused. So we have a beginner user learning pathway, and it&#8217;s basically the introduction to WordPress. You&#8217;ve never used WordPress before. What are pages? What are posts? How do I set the homepage instead of the blog home? All those kind of beginner situations. So you can go from knowing nothing about WordPress, to having a pretty good idea about how WordPress works, and you can put your site together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we have the next level which is, now you understand how WordPress works, now how do we go deeper? Maybe, how do themes work? How do themes get installed, and how do they work within your WordPress sites, or plugins, or those kind of things? How you can build forms. What options you have. What are plugins, and where do I find them? And those kind of questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for the developer side we had a similar thing, we said, right, let&#8217;s imagine somebody who&#8217;s now gone through all the user learning pathways, and they can use WordPress successfully, but now they want to go a step further. They want to start customising WordPress beyond what the no code tools allow. How do they start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, they first need to start and understand what HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL are, and JavaScript, and we need to give them an introduction to that. So we kind of, we define these learning pathways as a structured way of progressing from point A to point Z, say, within a specific realm. Be it user, designer. And we specifically isolated user, designer and developer, because those were kind of our, what we saw as our three big user stories, if you will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the pathways are kind of structured content. You begin at, if you like, lesson one, and you go through 3, 4, 5, 6, all the way up to 20 or what have you. And so, when you come out of that, at the end, you&#8217;ve acquired a body of learning. It feels like an LMS, a learning management system is kind of how it&#8217;s all held together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you log into the UI, you can see that you&#8217;ve completed this lesson, you&#8217;re up to lesson five, okay, clearly lesson six comes next. And if you complete one pathway, is there some intention that one pathway will then lead to another pathway, if you like? So if you complete the beginner bit, then a logical step would be to go to this next pathway, so that everything is sort of like a big spider web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:52] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Exactly that. So, for example, if we think about it, let&#8217;s go to brand new user, they come in, they start with the beginner user pathway. They finish that. Then from there, do they want to go further into the user side of things, and there&#8217;s a link to the next level pathway, and they can go through that. Or do they want to get into development? And then that links them to the beginner developer learning pathway. So depending on what type of scenario they have, they can then choose to go from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then additionally, if I just focus on, let&#8217;s say the beginner developer learning pathway. So in the beginner developer learning pathway we introduce the concepts of the web languages, and web servers, and all that kind of thing. And then we talk about an introduction to plugins. And at the end of the plugins module, well, what if they want to go further into plugin development? Then there will be a plugin developer learning pathway. And that&#8217;s all focusing on plugin developments, and all the things you would need to learn for plugin development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say they don&#8217;t want to do that, they continue along beginner developer. The next one, actually it&#8217;s the other way around, it&#8217;s theme first, then plugin. So they do theme, then plugin. At the end of the theme module, what if they want to go deeper into themes? Then there&#8217;s a link to the theme developer learning pathway. So they could either carry on with beginner, and just wrap that up, and get a broad understanding of sort of WordPress development, or they could choose to dive in deeper. And once they finished, for example, theme developer, they could come back, and then go through plugin developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do envision, as you say, the sort of spider web. At the moment, everything is very one lane. So it&#8217;s sort of beginner user, intermediate user, advanced user. The same for developer, the same for designer. But once all this content is created, then we can start thinking about how, sort of getting an idea of where people go and what they want to learn, and trying to tie these things in together so that, whichever path they take, there&#8217;s content for them to get to an eventual goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned earlier that there were real world conversations that you had. So i&#8217;ll just use the word Zoom for want of a better word. So you get on a Zoom call once a month. Do they fit into these learning pathways? So, for example, if I was to join the, oh I don&#8217;t know, the beginner WordPress one. I&#8217;m absolutely new to WordPress, I just want learn how to install it, and what a post is, and what a page is, and all of that kind of stuff. Is there any kind of Zoom call for that, or are we on our own? Does every pathway have its sort of dedicated time, or is it just all the pathways on the Zoom call at the same moment? How does that all work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:54] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> So as I mentioned, the course cohorts, the Zoom calls, they&#8217;re something that&#8217;s very new that we&#8217;ve kind of started experimenting with. So the first one we ran, I basically, I created a separate course for it, because we were doing it over a period of six weeks, so one call per week. So we essentially had to have enough content for somebody to kind of work on on a week by week basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also had to think about, well, how much time do folks actually have after their day jobs and whatever else to work on this content? So we tried to make sure that what they were working on could be done within about two to three hours. So they could do it on a Saturday morning if they&#8217;re working a day job, or an evening or whatever the case is. And so we created a separate course for that to work through. Work out the kinks, figure out how it&#8217;s all going to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate goal is to actually, with the next time we do a course cohort, is to actually take the folks through a set of modules in a specific learning pathway. So what I&#8217;m envisioning for, and because I&#8217;m focused on developers, what I&#8217;m envisioning for my next course cohort is to take, and I know you shared the beginner developer learning pathway in a previous podcast. But to take folks through maybe the first six, possibly six modules, because I think there&#8217;s 12 in total.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first six modules of the beginner developer learning pathway, which will cover an introduction to WordPress, and web servers, and how it works. The five programming languages. An introduction to plugins, themes, and blocks. So that&#8217;ll give them a good base, a good foundation to start from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then from there, if they choose to continue along that pathway on their own, they&#8217;re more than welcome to. But then what I would like to be able to do is, the next time we run a course cohort, I invite those folks back for part two. And we then take them on the next six, and we take them through that process. So that&#8217;s kind of what I&#8217;m envisioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s going to kind of be interesting to manage because eventually I&#8217;m going to be in a situation where I&#8217;m running one cohort for the first six and one cohort for the second six, because the previous first six are coming back for the second six, and I&#8217;m going to be cycling around like that. So I&#8217;m going to need folks to help me facilitate those, I can&#8217;t just do it all myself. And that&#8217;s part of what we do as well. But that&#8217;s kind of the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a nice endeavor, isn&#8217;t it? So almost recycling the knowledge through the people that been through the program. So the beginners of yesteryear are the ones who are training the beginnings of next year, if you know what I mean. Yeah, that&#8217;s really nice. Yeah, this lovely sort of feedback loop. That&#8217;s wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:01] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> And we actually had someone, sorry to interrupt you, we actually someone from the last cohort who actually has stepped up and said he would like to help facilitate the next one. So I&#8217;m hoping to invite him along for the next one that we kick off, so that he can maybe facilitate that and I can be more in a support role, so that he can then continue along. So that&#8217;s hopefully where this goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We have a lot of commercial courses online. You don&#8217;t have to Google too much to discover that there&#8217;s dozens probably, maybe hundreds, I don&#8217;t know, of courses online where this is the person&#8217;s job, if you like. They sell the course, you pay for access for a period of time, you use an LMS and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in that way you have this intuition, I guess that, okay, I&#8217;ve paid for it, hopefully it&#8217;s going to be updated and rah, rah, rah. But this, we should have pointed out probably before, there&#8217;s no cost to any of this to the end user. How does that work? Obviously there&#8217;s a lot of volunteer work, you are an Automattician so you are seconded to do this work. How does it all, I mean, it can&#8217;t be free, it can be free at the point of use, but it can&#8217;t be free to create. How does it afford to exist? How can that be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:03] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> I mean it&#8217;s as simple as Five for the Future. And I&#8217;ve publicly said this. When I joined Automattic I went and checked, and 5% of Automattic staff are working on WordPress Core. So Automattic puts its money where its mouth is. And the great thing about that is that, by doing that we make the learning content as free and open source as the software itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I want to just say this upfront, I have a great love and respect for anybody creating educational content for any kind of product, service, whatever, on their own. It is not something I could do. I am very fortunate that I get paid a regular salary to do this. And a few people have said to me, you could probably earn so much more if you did this on your own. And they&#8217;re probably right, but it&#8217;s just not within my brain space to be able to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have great respect for folks who can do this on their own and make a living out of it. And I love the fact that all these options exist because what I teach, and what someone like Fränk Klein, or Nyasha Green, they&#8217;re all folks who have got courses online that are either free or paid. What they teach and what I teach are all from our subjective viewpoint. So it&#8217;s based on our experiences, based on our knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I encourage folks to try out these different courses if they can afford to do them, because you&#8217;re going to get pieces of information that you wouldn&#8217;t get from someone like myself, because of different levels of experience, different backgrounds, different interests, whatever. But what I want to be able to do is I want to be able to make it possible so that folks who can&#8217;t afford to learn these things, students, folks in third world countries, can go online and get something. That&#8217;s my goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they come to Learn WordPress, and they learn the basics, and then they go off and learn and pay for another course because they get hired a job, and that job pays for them to learn somewhere else, I am happy. Because ultimately that is the goal of democratising something. You know, we democratise publishing by building this open source software, and making it possible for companies to earn money off it. So I want to democratise WordPress learning and make it possible for folks to learn what they need to do to get a job, and then be able to pay for other courses and increase their learning that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think lucky is the wrong word, but when I was going through on another podcast that I do, when I was just explaining that some of these courses were coming around, you know, the introduction to WordPress course, and the developer course and what have you that have dropped in the last few months. I just felt an enormous sense of, oh I don&#8217;t know, privilege or luck that that&#8217;s all there. That anybody on the planet who has the capacity to connect to the internet, does have the capacity to learn WordPress completely for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as you said, you may go off in different directions, and Learn is bound to the WordPress project itself, you know, it&#8217;s not going to explore this page builder, or that page builder because that&#8217;s out of the bounds. But what a privilege to just roll into web development as a project, you know, maybe it&#8217;s a hobby at the moment, and find a bunch of really credible resources online, and then think to yourself, okay, where&#8217;s the checkout? There&#8217;s no checkout. It&#8217;s just completely for free. And that is, that&#8217;s miraculous, frankly. And it could not have been that way, but it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:07] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> It is, absolutely. And the way I always look at this is, you talk about other page builders, and let&#8217;s talk about other plugins, and other themes, and whatever the case may be. We talk about perfect utopias. What I would love to see is a world where agency X, you know, Human Made, all these web agencies, I&#8217;m just mentioning names, XWP, 10up, all of those. They&#8217;ve got new developers coming in, junior developers coming in, and instead of them having to build, hire somebody, or pay somebody to make content for internal training, they can just link them off to Learn WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then those folks can go through the training and then be productive members of that team. And then that person who&#8217;s creating the content can do something else for the company, can create other content that the company needs, as opposed to having to recreate this educational content all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve had conversations with hosting companies. You know, hosting companies, they have video editors who have to both create educational videos for customers, but also promotional videos and all that to grow the company. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if they could just focus on their promotional videos and grow the company, and send customers links to Learn WordPress? They don&#8217;t even have to send them links to Learn WordPress, it&#8217;s as open source as the software. So everything we release is creative commons essentially, because that&#8217;s the text video version of open source software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if they want to include it in their customer support portals, all of our videos are on YouTube, so folks could link to it from YouTube if they want to. Imagine how much opportunity it creates for them to use those folks for other things, for growing the business, for customer interactions, or whatever the case may be. As opposed to having to recreate the wheel every time, because every hosting company needs to create support videos. Every hosting company needs to create a, this is pages, this is posts, blah, blah, blah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a really nice idea. I&#8217;m going to go off piste for just a moment, and I don&#8217;t want to go down this alley particularly, but also, if you go to some of the courses, I&#8217;m going to coin a phrase, they are Playgroundable. You can click a button, the button at the moment says, practice with WordPress Playground. And if you&#8217;re not familiar with that button, just go and click it and hold your breath for about two seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll basically get a functioning website inside the browser with the course content there, all of the bits and pieces that are mentioned. So that impediment, even the impediment of, okay, go download something like Local. Install WordPress. Now do this, do that. Make sure these settings are all configured. Even that headache is gone, and that is just utterly remarkable. I don&#8217;t know if you want to just quickly get into that, but how amazing is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:23] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Absolutely. Matt said this at his summer update, pay attention to Playground. So I just want to mention, you talk about the practice with WordPress Playground button. That button doesn&#8217;t yet load up the Playground instance with all the course content. But there&#8217;s currently a conversation that I&#8217;m actively involved in, and have been for the last few weeks, where we&#8217;re going to make that possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am able to load up the code example, for example, of the lesson that I&#8217;m working on in a Playground block inside the lesson. And folks can physically code inside the window and see the changes on the preview. And then there&#8217;s a button where you can open that in a new tab and it goes full screen in your laptop, or your computer, or whatever. And you can just live code it there, see the changes, see what breaks, see the debug output. And then there&#8217;s a button to download that code to your machine so that you can upload it to GitHub or wherever you want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playground is going to change the way we teach WordPress to folks, and I can&#8217;t wait for it to be, it&#8217;s like 99% there. There&#8217;s a few tweaks we&#8217;re busy making to get it there. There&#8217;s also quite a bit of work we&#8217;ve been working on with accessibility of Playground. You probably know Alex Stein, he&#8217;s been helping us test that, so massive thanks to him, so that there&#8217;s no accessibility issues. So yes, when the relaunch happens at the end of this month, beginning of this month, I&#8217;m hoping that that&#8217;s all going to be in place. And then as you&#8217;re sitting there reading through the lesson or watching the video, and you want to try this out, as you say, you click a button, it opens a tab, and you just code, and you just see it do its thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s properly profound. I remember when I first saw Playground, I actually didn&#8217;t make the mental leap to what it could do. To be honest, I&#8217;m not sure many people did. Adam Zielinski did. The rest of us were sort of caught short a little bit, but I thought, oh, that&#8217;s novel, that&#8217;s interesting. But it feels to me as if the education piece, not just tied to WordPress, but in schools, in universities, in colleges, that seems to be one of the most useful things. You know, that ability to, okay, we want to teach you something, okay, you want all the resources, click that button, there they are, right there. And it&#8217;ll be fascinating to see how that goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:14] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Very quickly, before we wrap this up, I just want to share a story. I remember at a previous WordCamp in Cape Town we did a kids camp. And all we wanted to do was teach kids what WordPress is and how you use it. We spent the whole morning just getting them to install a local development environment and getting a WordPress install set up. So that&#8217;s half a day lost. Now you don&#8217;t have that half a day. You just dive straight in, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And also probably the interest as well. You know, you&#8217;ll have lost a few kids along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:37] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> We did. Half of them lost it halfway through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Anyway, so keep your eye on Playground, and also I&#8217;ll link to the episode that I did with Adam Zielinski. The problem with that episode is it goes out of date like in a heart beat because everything&#8217;s changing so quick. Which actually leads me nicely to that question in terms of Learn. Because in the last five, six years, WordPress has changed phenomenally, but it feels like that pace of change, especially in the last year, has gone even more critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UI is about to change entirely for massive part, well, in fact has in many ways, but is about to undergo major changes. How do you keep up with all of this? And I mean obviously you do it by doing the work, but that must be a constant kind of thorn in the side of a project like Learn, because you release a piece of content and then six weeks later, oh okay, that no longer works, we&#8217;ve got to go back. So it must be this constant cycle of check that it&#8217;s still working, okay, remake the videos, try to slot it in somewhere, make sure all the links are working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:38] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> I will say that this is one area where the learning pathways sort of project that we have now, and the learning pathway itself is essentially just a course in an LMS. And I think you mentioned this in the last podcast, we&#8217;re using Sensei underneath. But it&#8217;s just a really big course. In the past we&#8217;ve had courses which were like four or five lessons and that was the course. Now we&#8217;re talking about 50 lessons or whatever, broken down into modules with activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But structurally it&#8217;s just a course. It&#8217;s nothing special, but it&#8217;s a course with a very specific goal. And so one of the things that we try and do is we try and isolate specific topics within each module, and then within each lesson with each module, we try and isolate even further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My experience has been that a lot of what I&#8217;m teaching is foundational software development within WordPress, which doesn&#8217;t really change much. That having been said, there&#8217;s a contributor that I&#8217;ve been working with, Cynthia Norman, you might know her, she&#8217;s from Canada. She recently won the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship to WordCamp US. She has been working with me on the theme developer learning pathway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in the process of that thing, so we started working on that at about the beginning of this year. And in the process of that, we had a number of things pop up here and there that have changed. My general attitude about these things, and this might be because I&#8217;m a developer primarily, an educator second to that. But my general attitude about these things is that, even though something has changed, the core content is still useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it does require you to maybe overlook some UI change. Maybe a button is a different text, or it&#8217;s in a place, or whatever. But underneath it all, it&#8217;s all more or less the same. My colleague Wes, also an Automattician, also sponsored to work with the training team, focusing on the user facing side, he has a much harder time, because things change a lot more drastically for him than what they do for me. But his advantage there is his courses, his learning pathways are a little bit shorter than mine because there&#8217;s not so much in depth technical knowledge that he needs to present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, it is a realistic thing. It&#8217;s a conversation we have many, many, many, times, and we&#8217;ve kind of settled on, we will fix it in post, if you will. So we wait for somebody, as much as we can, we wait for somebody to report the issue and then we fix it when it&#8217;s reported. That might seem a little bit silly to some folks, but ultimately that&#8217;s our advantage with the fact that we don&#8217;t rely on the income of the sale of these courses to be able to get folks learning them. So if it&#8217;s not super, super up to date, it&#8217;s not the end of the world really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s where I say I respect folks who are having to keep super, super up to date, because if they don&#8217;t, then people don&#8217;t pay for their courses. So that&#8217;s our little bit of an advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still have people coming back to me today, I did two courses on Block Themes. Developers Guide to Block Themes in 2022, and that is now 3, 4, 5 versions out of date. But I still have people coming back to me and saying, this was still valuable because it gave me the core foundational knowledge that I didn&#8217;t have, and then I could just build on top of that. So I don&#8217;t see that to be a huge problem. We just need to, when we&#8217;re planning these things, we do need to be aware of them. We do need to be fairly reactive when things do get picked up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s great is we have Anne McCarthy working with us. So Anne McCarthy is one of our subject matter experts in the training team. And she will often, when she sees a change coming, she will tag us. And so there&#8217;s actually one lesson in the beginner developer learning pathway that I&#8217;m going to be editing this week. Because Anne tagged a change that was coming in, I think 6.6, and I&#8217;m going to be editing it this week to make that difference. So we do have those kind of feedback loops, which is very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s really nice. It just all speaks to the whole thing, there&#8217;s a cohesion there. And that kind of leads me into this next thing, and it feels as if, I don&#8217;t really know how to encapsulate this in a question, it&#8217;s maybe more just an opinion. But it does feel like projects like Learn, so learn.wordpress.org, or we&#8217;ll just call it Learn, have got a much more, air quotes, I&#8217;m doing air quotes, professional thing about them. That&#8217;s not a particularly well worded question. Let me try that again. It feels like, things like Learn are more professional now than they were before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That isn&#8217;t to say that what was before was unprofessional, but it does seem like there is more focus on making things utterly complete. You know, look professional from the outset. Have a nice UI. Have a nice UX. All of those things being taken into consideration. Is it just me? Is that just coincidence? Or is there some sort of imperative to make things look, and again, air quotes, enterprise ready. Is there something going on there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:45] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> So I would say that the phrase is not enterprise ready, but the phrase you could think about as, let&#8217;s do great work. This is public information. So you might remember there was some kerfuffle a while back on the Core, the Make Core blog about the redesign of the WordPress.org landing page. And Matt was quite vocal about the fact that sometimes design by committee doesn&#8217;t work. Sometimes somebody needs to make a decision and take a stance and say, this is the way we&#8217;re going, this is the way we&#8217;re doing things because this will take us to where we need to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember vividly when I went to my first WordCamp Europe in 2018 in Serbia, I was still working as a freelancer at the time, I wasn&#8217;t even working at Castos yet. I was working as a freelancer at Codeable, and I had the opportunity to travel to WorldCamp Europe. You might remember, you actually messaged me in Slack and said, is that you asking a question? Because I think you saw me on the YouTube stream or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I did, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:31] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> That was the first time I got to ask a question of Matt ever in my life. And my question to him was, why the block editor? Why are we doing all of this? And I mean I wasn&#8217;t an Automattician at the time, I was just a freelance WordPress developer contributing to the project where I could. And the answer that he gave me that day kind of stuck with me. And he said, what brought us to where we are now is not going to take us to where we need to go. And that is kind of what all of this is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;ve never had this conversation with Matt, my CEO, around this. This is still back to when I was still, this is Matt, my BDFL. But I&#8217;ve always felt that it&#8217;s interesting, I come from PHP based open source software. So my experience of open source communities was largely framed by the communities I was involved in, which was the PHP community, the Cake PHP community, and the Laravel community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In those communities, the founder, the creator of the software, the BDFL, whatever you want to call them, has a very distinct and controlling voice. If you look at the Laravel software, Taylor Otwell says, this is what we&#8217;re doing. And he doesn&#8217;t ask for anybody&#8217;s opinions. He says, this is what we&#8217;re doing, and this is the way we&#8217;re going to go forward. And nobody shouts about it. Nobody complains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying we shouldn&#8217;t have a voice and we shouldn&#8217;t have opinions, but I do believe in any software, open source or closed, or otherwise, there needs to be somebody who makes a final choice. There needs to be a captain of the ship. And sometimes we need to disagree with the captain&#8217;s decision, but commit to whatever the vision is and see if it works. And sometimes we just need to let the captain make the decision and hope for the best. Sometimes it&#8217;s going to work out, sometimes it isn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do feel like, and again, this is not something I&#8217;ve been impressed upon internally or otherwise. I do feel like Matt has decided he wants to sort of take the ship in a certain direction, because he believes that this is the right direction for the ship, and the redesign is part of that. You may have noticed, he is commenting on the Core blog, posting on the Core blog a lot more than he ever used to. My perception is that he feels the need to sort of take control again because he sees a certain vision and he needs to guide the ship in that vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my opinion on that is, well, it&#8217;s his software ultimately. Were it not for him and Mike launching this, and driving this forward, I wouldn&#8217;t be doing this today. So sometimes I need to step back and let the vision play itself out, and see where it goes. And so far it seems to be working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, if you obsess about WordPress quite as much as I do, you would see these little tendrils of professionalism in the way that WordPress is presenting itself. Now, you may like the design of, I don&#8217;t know, the wordpress.org redesign that happened recently, you know, the showcase, and all of those kind of things. You may like them, you may not, but they are kind of opinionated. They seem be very modern. And they are, and I was just using the phrase earlier, enterprise ready, they just speak of, okay, this project isn&#8217;t stale. We are here for your small projects, but we&#8217;re also here for your gigantic projects as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And feels like the impetus on having people like you, boots on ground, paying for you to make this content, it feels that that whole thing is just some sort of bigger vision in the background, which isn&#8217;t necessarily spoken about, but all of the little bits and pieces together mean that, yeah, you can have confidence that there&#8217;s some bigger picture going on. There&#8217;s a direction, there&#8217;s an arrow going in a certain direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, okay, so I&#8217;ve got a final question, and that is that, if I go to learn.wordpress.org, I&#8217;m a lucky person in that my native language is English. So everywhere I go, I see everything written in English, and that makes my life tremendously easy. Now, I know that a lot of people speak English but, how do we educate the people who don&#8217;t?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:56] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> That&#8217;s a great question. So that is my blessing and my curse. I grew up in a country where English is my first language. I might be living in Africa, but English is my first language. So that means I can easily create and consume that content, but it&#8217;s very difficult for me to translate it. I could translate it to Afrikaans, but that&#8217;s only going to help South Africa, not the rest of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is something that we do need. We do need more folks translating content. Now, we are very fortunate in the training team that we have a number of English second language speakers. One of our team reps, Ben, who you might have met at WordCamp Europe this year, I know he spoke about Learn WordPress. He&#8217;s originally Australian, but grew up in Japan. So Japanese is actually his first language, and English is his second language ironically. And so he&#8217;s very committed towards, internationalising our Learn WordPress content. So we need translators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons why we have the text version of all content on Learn WordPress is so that somebody can translate it. It&#8217;s also the reason we have subtitles, not only for accessibility, but so that someone can translate those subtitles as well. But that only happens with translators, and it&#8217;s not something that I can do. So if you are a translator, if you are somebody who speaks another language and you want to contribute to WordPress, one of the easiest things you can do is take one of the lessons in any one of the courses and help us translate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our Make training team site, in our handbook, we have an onboarding page, and one of the options in that onboarding is, I want to translate content. So we want to try and make it as easy as possible for folks to translate, but we need those folks to come on board. And so getting the word out there is probably one of our biggest tasks, is to get as many translators as we can because one of our goals is to make all this content somehow fully translated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ve spoken relentlessly for the last 40 minutes in very positive tones about Learn, but obviously there&#8217;s going to be things like that, like translations, also missing content. Content that is on the roadmap, but far away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:44] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> You saw one of them the other day when you were going through the course on your podcast. One of the episodes, one of the lessons had been, what had happened? And I don&#8217;t mind sharing the story because it&#8217;s quite funny. So somebody had translated the lesson and then assigned it to the course, not realising that doing that would&#8217;ve overwritten the original English one. So what you saw was I think a Tamil translation of that lesson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:01] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> So, wonderful that the person did the translation, but we hadn&#8217;t quite figured out the process of translating it yet, which is why it came up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That was a funny moment. But the broader question there is, obviously you need more boots on the ground, the project will never be finished, it&#8217;s just not the nature of it. Where do people go if they&#8217;re interested, having listened to this, they&#8217;re interested? I mean, maybe you want to drop a Slack channel, or an email address, or a URL. Whatever you think will serve best for getting people involved with learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:29] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> So the best thing that I can suggest is go to make.wordpress.org/training. So that&#8217;ll take you to the training team blog. And then right at the top of that page, just next to the Make WordPress training title, there&#8217;s a link that says Getting Started. Click on that link, scroll down a little bit, and there&#8217;s a video of Ben, who I mentioned earlier, introducing you to the training team. And then there&#8217;s an entire onboarding process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go through that process. In my opinion, as somebody who&#8217;s been contributing to WordPress for about nine years, we have, as the trading team, one of the best onboarding pages in the teams, because Ben really took the time to sit down and go, right, what do new folks need to know? Where do we need to guide them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He even takes you through your first sort of three contributions and how to do that. And then we also have, tied into that, we have what we call the Training Guide Program, where if you want to, you can get paired up with a training team member to take you through the onboarding process, if you need someone to take you through that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to get involved, if you&#8217;re a translator, and I&#8217;m going to start calling for people here now. If you&#8217;re a translator, if you&#8217;re somebody who can do research and script writing. If you&#8217;re somebody who likes to review these videos and give us feedback. If you&#8217;re somebody who&#8217;s a video editor and you can edit from a recorded voice, you can just put images together and create videos, please go to that site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s make.wordpress.org/training, go through the onboarding process and see what role you fit in. And then join us. That onboarding takes you through to where to join in the Slack channel, and who the team is, and what we do, and who the team, it covers everything. But that would be the place that I would recommend you get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s really interesting because, usually when there&#8217;s a teacher student relationship, it&#8217;s very much top down. The teacher has all the expertise and is going to disseminate it down. But from what you&#8217;ve said, anybody, whether you be a video editor, an audio editor, whether you&#8217;re just interested in reviewing content, or translating content, there&#8217;s a place. You don&#8217;t have to be that right at the top, educator, down. There&#8217;s a whole jigsaw of different jobs underneath which are needed, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:25] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> And I&#8217;m going to cheat a little bit here, and I&#8217;m also going to say this. And this is my opinion, this is not the opinion of my company, this is not the opinion of the team, but this is my personal opinion. As somebody who has been contributing for the last nine years to multiple different teams, the beauty of Learn WordPress is we are our own little enclosed environment. We have our own code base for learn.wordpress.org. So if you want to commit patches, and bugs, and pull requests, you do it to that code base on its own. You don&#8217;t have to finagle WordPress develop. We&#8217;ve got our own one. And the content is all managed on our own GitHub repository within that, sort of, code base repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re kind of, I always talk about us as this very sort of elite strike force within the WordPress community, focused on learning. And we have all the elements and all the access that we need. We don&#8217;t need to really bother other teams like I&#8217;m sure you know, if you want to fix something on wordpress.org, you have to commit code here, and you have to connect with meta, and you have to log a bug over here. It&#8217;s kind of all over the place. If you want to commit to Core, you&#8217;ve got to find the right Slack channel for the right thing, and the right component, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn is self-contained. So it&#8217;s one of the best places to contribute for the first time, if you&#8217;re a first time contributor, because everything is in one space. We don&#8217;t really have to bother other teams too much. We&#8217;ve got all the tools we need, and we just need more, as you say, boots on the floor to achieve our goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is absolutely perfect. I will make sure that all of the bits and pieces that you mentioned just then get into the show notes. So head over to wptavern.com and search for the episode with Jonathan Bossenger in it. So that&#8217;s all the questions that I&#8217;ve got. Thank you so much for chatting to me today, Jonathan. I&#8217;ve really appreciated it, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:49] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> Awesome. No problem. Thank you so much for having me. And I would just like to say, to everybody who was in the, where you highlighted of the developer learning pathway. So it was yourself, Tammie was there, Michelle, and I can&#8217;t remember the other chap&#8217;s name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just want to say what a wonderful experience it was watching something that I&#8217;ve spent the better past of the last year working on, being so well received by folks in the community. One of the comments that was made, I can&#8217;t remember the chap&#8217;s name, but he said something about, he can see that there is a love for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that really just touched me because that is exactly where I come from. There&#8217;s a love to teach others, and it&#8217;s so nice to see that this is appreciated by our community. So I just want to say thank you to you, for highlighting it for everybody who was in that podcast. It was a really, really cool day, and I spent the entire day with this massive smile on my face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, nice. Well, that makes me happy. Thank you so much for chatting to me today, Jonathan. Really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:38] <strong>Jonathan Bossenger:</strong> No problem. Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://jonathanbossenger.com/about/\">Jonathan Bossenger</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan, based in Cape Town, South Africa, has been an integral part of the WordPress community for nearly a decade. Transitioning from software development to web and then WordPress development, he found his passion in education. Since attending his first WordCamp in 2015, he has focused on creating educational content for WordPress developers. Now employed at Automattic as a developer educator, he contributes to the Learn platform, helping to train and guide new developers in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s on the podcast today to explain some of the ways that you can learn WordPress with up to date, freely available content. We discuss the goal of making WordPress learning accessible globally, especially for those who can&#8217;t afford expensive courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion gets into the transformative potential of the Learn WordPress platform, especially in the era of Playground, which will enable interactive coding practice without the need for external tools. Jonathan sees this as a game-changer for web agencies, providing a streamlined training resource for new developers and conserving valuable time and resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cover Jonathan&#8217;s journey from software developer to developer educator, supported by his former employer, Castos. He shares the challenges of keeping educational content current amidst WordPress&#8217;s rapid evolution, and the importance of staying updated with WordPress Core developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation also touches on the structured learning pathways designed to guide learners from beginner to advanced levels, segmented into user, designer, and developer categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The professionalisation of WordPress projects like Learn, and the essential role of contributors in translating and internationalising content to reach a broader audience comes under the microscope as well, and Jonathan reflects upon the dynamic nature of open-source communities, stressing the need for decisive leadership in software development decisions from time to time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end we talk about the many ways that you can assist the Learn project, and there are many&nbsp; more ways than you might imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re curious about how people learn about WordPress, and how you can be a part of that project, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn

is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>Birgit:<br />Hi, I am your host, Birgit, and we are here with another episode of <em>The WordPress Way</em>, where we dive deep into the heart and soul of WordPress, exploring the cutting edge and the incredible people shaping its future. I have two lovely guests today on our show, and I would love for them to introduce themselves. I have onboard Megan and Mike. Please, Megan, tell our audience a bit about yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Megan:<br />Hi. Yeah, so I&#8217;m Megan Rose. I’ve been pretty active in the WordPress community since around 2014, so people might know me from there. I’m based in northeast Ohio, and I work with the WordPress community here, as well as on the WordCamp US organizing team and the Incident Response Team. Alternatively, people might know me from Codeable, where I’m the Head of Community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />That’s impressive. To explain to the audience, you and I met previously at several WordCamps, and it’s really good to see that someone like you is also part of the Incident Response Team, which plays a crucial role in improving DEIB. Mike, would you mind telling the audience a bit about yourself?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Sure. I also work at Codeable alongside Megan, and we’re on the same team. That’s how I ended up here—we’re recently coworkers, and she just asked if I’d be willing to come on. Let’s see, my background is not in WordPress. The majority of my background—and my degree, in fact—is in social work, but I also have a few years of experience in sales and other customer-facing roles. In my, I guess, “free time”—or rather, not-work-related time—I’ve also been a volunteer. It’s called a Harassment and Grievance Officer, doing similar code of conduct work for a local community organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Wow, really impressive. It’s interesting to learn more about coworkers while recording a podcast. As Mike said, I also recently joined Codeable within the support team, but nevertheless, I invited you both because we share a common passion for improving diversity and fostering inclusion. Mike, you mentioned the code of conduct work—how do you approach that best? For me, English is not my first language, so sometimes it’s difficult to articulate myself clearly. Please bear with me. I’ve prepared some questions and would love to hear from you, Megan. Can you share your experience with community management and the strategies you’ve found effective in fostering an inclusive environment? You mentioned you’re on the Incident Response Team within the global WordPress community. Could you share some of your experiences and what you encounter daily?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Megan:<br />Yeah, sure. I’ll start by saying my experiences are my own and not necessarily shared by others at Codeable, but when I first got involved in the WordPress community, it felt a little like a boys’ club. There were times when community members would say things that made me uncomfortable, and I even had someone slide into my DMs at one point. So, I knew I had some work ahead of me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I already had experience handling code of conduct issues and felt confident tackling these kinds of challenges—and with the support of management—I dove right into laying the groundwork for a more welcoming environment, especially for women and gender minorities. One of the first things I did was introduce a code of conduct process. I actually borrowed heavily from the WordPress community&#8217;s code of conduct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In WordPress, there are two codes of conduct: one is event-specific, used at WordCamps, and the other is the overarching one that was introduced, I believe, in 2020, when things moved online due to the pandemic. The shift to online spaces made it clear we needed a more comprehensive approach. I adapted that structure and began reporting at the end of the year on how many incidents were dealt with, anonymizing the data for privacy. I think that helped build trust, especially within gender minority and LGBTQ+ groups, who had previously experienced discomfort in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also made adjustments to our termination procedures, requiring a staff vote, and moved towards more education-focused responses rather than purely punitive measures. I’m proud of my ability to have one-on-one conversations with people who may have said or done something that made someone else feel unwelcome. Often, these are long conversations, but they help change minds and foster better understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />That’s really interesting. You mentioned the global WordPress community, but you also work with Codeable, fostering its expert community, which exists within the broader WordPress ecosystem. Given the male-dominated nature of this field and the cultural diversity, how do you navigate conversations about inclusive language and respect? For example, when I attended the CloudFest Hackathon, I worked on improving the check for inclusive language within WordPress. Though the project didn’t turn out as I envisioned, I learned a lot about cultural perspectives. How do you raise awareness when issues occur, especially when different people might have different boundaries or triggers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Megan:<br />Yeah, I think goal number one when I first started was to earn the community’s trust and respect. That’s not something that happens overnight. Everyone’s worked somewhere where a new person comes in and starts making big changes, and it can feel off-putting. So, I didn’t want to be that person. I spent a lot of time just having casual, one-on-one conversations, getting to know people, and building trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people have experienced negative things in the past and reported them with no real outcome, there’s a silencing effect. They’re less likely to report things again in the future. I made it a priority to show that there was a process in place and that it would be followed fairly. In some cases, people reported incidents to me directly, expressing fear that following the formal process might negatively impact the income of the person they were reporting. It’s a complicated situation when you’re afraid of affecting someone’s livelihood. This can make it harder for people to come forward, and I think that hesitation exists within the WordPress space as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Yes, thank you for sharing that insight. As you mentioned, some people may be hesitant to report incidents because they feel their concerns aren&#8217;t serious enough, or they fear consequences. But everyone has different boundaries, and we need to have systems that allow people to express discomfort or request mediation. One of the things I love about the WordPress community is that, overall, we care for each other. Mike, as someone newer to the WordPress community, but with a background in social work, could you share your observations about the WordPress ecosystem, especially compared to your previous experiences?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Sure. Like I said, most of my background is in social work, which definitely helps in customer service roles. My direct experience with WordPress or open-source communities has been limited, but as a teenager, I was really into Mozilla and the launch of Firefox. I’ve always been more interested in the philosophical side of open source rather than the software development side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From an outside perspective, I try to bring a sense of non-judgmental acceptance, something I learned from social work. This helps when dealing with code of conduct situations where people make mistakes, but that doesn’t mean they’re bad people. Mistakes happen. I try to approach these situations with empathy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we talk about diversity in open source, especially WordPress, I think there’s a bit of a contradiction. WordPress exists within capitalism, and as long as a handful of companies control WordPress, we can’t fully democratize publishing the way we might hope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />You bring up a really interesting point. There’s always that tension between the community-driven aspect of WordPress and the capitalist environment it operates within. I remember discussions about creating a governance board for WordPress—there’s still some optimism around that. From your perspective, how can we reconcile these contradictions and push for more transparency and fairness, especially when it comes to pay equity?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Yeah, we’ve talked about this before. I believe transparency is crucial, especially when it comes to pay. It’s easy for companies to say they care about diversity, but it means nothing if there’s a significant pay disparity that goes unaddressed. Gender-based pay disparities, for example, are still very common, and they’re not something that should be shrugged off as someone else’s problem. It’s our problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a company like Buffer, for example. They’ve publicly listed every employee’s name and salary on their website. That kind of transparency is how you show you’re serious about fairness. In the U.S., it’s illegal for companies to prevent employees from discussing their salaries, but people are still discouraged from doing so. If you really care about diversity and inclusion, that transparency has to be there, and it starts with talking to your coworkers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />That’s a powerful point, and it connects to the broader conversation about company culture. It’s not just about what you do as an individual but about creating systemic changes. Megan, you mentioned some great strategies earlier about de-escalation and setting boundaries. Would you mind expanding on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Megan:<br />Sure. De-escalation is one of my favorite things—it feels like an art form to me. I try to blend it seamlessly into conversations, often using humor to diffuse tension. If things get heated, especially during a video call, I might make a joke like, “Well, we all know politicians always have our best interests at heart, right?” It’s a light way of finding common ground, without getting preachy. Humor works in face-to-face or video interactions but might not be appropriate in something like Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When humor doesn’t work, I’m comfortable with a hard pivot. If someone’s talking about something I don’t want to engage with, I might just say, “Okay, let’s move on.” You can also ask people about their personal interests—like how their kids are doing in school. It helps shift the conversation without creating conflict.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />That’s such a useful approach, and it really resonates with me. And speaking of personal milestones, I have to mention—today was my grandson’s first day of school. He’s six years old, and I’m so proud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike, to wrap things up, could you share some tips on improving written communication, especially in support roles, where you often only have text to work with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike:<br />Absolutely. One of the biggest things I’ve noticed is that people often aren’t clear in their communication because they assume others understand the context. This can be especially true with native speakers, who might use casual language or euphemisms that aren’t clear to everyone. My advice is to always draft your message, then reread it from the perspective of someone who doesn’t know what you’re thinking. Precision is key—being direct and clear avoids misunderstandings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another tip is to focus on being non-judgmental, especially when addressing mistakes. We all make errors, but that doesn’t define us as people. It’s important to approach situations with empathy and understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit:<br />Thank you both for sharing your insights and personal stories. It’s been a truly enlightening conversation. I hope everyone listening takes a moment to reflect on what we’ve discussed—pat yourselves on the back for the work you’re doing, but also remember to take care of your own mental health. Megan, Mike, I’m so grateful for your time today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to our listeners, thank you for tuning in to <em>The WordPress Way</em>.

This requires time, one-on-one conversations, and an understanding of the existing dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Code of Conduct Implementation</strong>: Introducing a clear and transparent code of conduct can foster a safer and more welcoming environment. Megan emphasized the importance of having processes in place for handling incidents, reporting them anonymously, and ensuring follow-through to build confidence in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>De-escalation and Conflict Resolution</strong>: Megan shared practical techniques for de-escalating tense conversations, particularly in a global and diverse community. Humor, setting boundaries, and using a &#8220;hard pivot&#8221; to shift topics can be effective strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Importance of Transparency and Fairness in Pay</strong>: Mike highlighted the need for transparency in compensation, arguing that real diversity and inclusion efforts are incomplete without addressing pay disparities. They/them advocates for open discussions about pay and collective action to address inequalities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Written Communication in Customer Support</strong>: In support roles, written communication is key. Mike suggested drafting and rereading responses from the perspective of someone unfamiliar with the situation to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Navigating Global Cultural Differences</strong>: In a globally distributed community like WordPress, cultural differences must be acknowledged and respected. Community leaders should foster inclusive environments that take into account diverse perspectives and backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Promoting Inclusivity in Male-Dominated Fields</strong>: The WordPress and tech industries can sometimes feel male-dominated, but intentional efforts, like those from Megan, to create welcoming spaces for women and gender minorities can make a significant impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Democratizing Governance and Decision-Making</strong>: The conversation touched on the broader topic of democratizing the structures within the WordPress ecosystem and the companies that support it, including calls for more employee representation and shared decision-making in companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/megabyterose/\">Megan on WordPress.org</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.codeable.io/story/\">Codeable</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/community-code-of-conduct/\">WordPress Community Code of Conduct</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/course/incident-response-team-training/\">WordPress Incident Response Team training</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Sep 2024 11:39:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.7 Roadmap Includes New Default Theme, APIs, and Media Enhancements\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=161079\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-7-roadmap-includes-new-default-theme-apis-and-media-enhancements\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3517:\"<p>Anne McCarthy has unveiled the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/09/03/roadmap-to-6-7/\">roadmap for WordPress 6.7</a>, slated for release on November 12, 2024. This will be the final major update of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She has emphasized that “More than anything though, this release brings refinement to how everything connects together to create a more seamless WordPress experience, whether you’re trying to upload a HEIC image to your site or display a selection of posts with the Query Loop block.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.7 will ship with a new default theme, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/08/15/introducing-twenty-twenty-five/\">Twenty Twenty-Five</a>, that “embodies ultimate flexibility and adaptability”.

Users can expect options to hide or show filters in the interface, adjust the density of information in the grid layout, and configure the grid layout&#8217;s aspect ratio to their preferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Query Loop block will be updated to ease customization. Improvements include refining settings copy and context detection for a more intuitive user experience. For a better editing experience, WordPress 6.7 will introduce an option to zoom out and work at the pattern level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Significant updates to media handling are also on the way, including <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/08/15/automatic-conversion-of-heic-images-to-jpeg-in-wordpress-6-7/\">HEIC support</a>, auto sizes for lazy loaded images, and more background image support at individual and global levels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other highlights of WordPress 6.7 include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Updates to design tools, including shadow support for Group blocks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved support for PHP 8.x and removing code specific for unsupported versions.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new split view for the iframe post editor to ensure a consistent WYSIWYG experience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Removing the experimental status of typography blocks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new feature in the Styles interface allowing users to customize theme presets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne has cautioned that the new features mentioned in the post “ is being actively pursued, but doesn’t necessarily mean each will make it into the final release of WordPress 6.7.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested users can look into the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/08/16/hallway-hangout-recording-lets-chat-about-whats-next-in-gutenberg-august-2024/\">demos</a> shared during a recent hallway hangout to get a glimpse into what&#8217;s being developed for this release and future updates.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 05 Sep 2024 18:03:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Jyolsna\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: WordPress Blog WPLift Joins E2M Solutions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=161018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-blog-wplift-joins-e2m-solutions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2087:\"<p>The popular WordPress blog <a href=\"https://wplift.com/wplift-is-acquired-by-e2m-solutions/\">WPLift has been acquired</a> by E2M Solutions, a leading white-label partner with operations in India and the United States.

Welcome to yet another session of the notorious, not-so-notorious-yet accessibility podcast at Do the Woo. With me today is Maestro Stevens from Iconic Templates. Now, some of you may know him, while to some of you, he may come as a total surprise. But I promise you, this is going to be a very entertaining conversation about scalability, accessibility, being part of the WordPress community—especially in that regard—and, of course, e-commerce and accessibility. But as usual, we are trying to get guests on the show who are in the midst of learning about or working with accessibility, instead of always featuring people who already know everything. There are so many people who don’t know yet, and we’re going to get the other specialists on for sure at some point. The goal is that we all learn how to implement accessibility in e-commerce because it&#8217;s incredibly important. We are all learning, we are all struggling, and we are all going to get there at some point. Also with us today is Bob Dunn, and today Bob is representing Taeka, who, due to circumstances, couldn’t be with us today. He is here to protect all of you from me and Maestro talking too much about unrelated things, because we like to babble, right, Bob?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Right? Yeah, yeah. I’ll be the podcast bouncer, and that’s it. I’m always accessible to do these things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah, that’s wonderful. So, for people who don’t know me, a little bit of my background: I’m an accessibility specialist and a big mouth in the WordPress community. I love to connect people, I love to learn, I love to teach, and I hope I can bring you some extras every time we do this. And Maestro, I would say let’s go. Can you tell us a little bit more about yourself and what you’re doing in daily life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yes, yes. Thank you, Anne, and thank you, Bob, as well for having me on. I’ve been greatly anticipating this opportunity. But just a little bit about me—as Anne already said, my name is Maestro Stevens, and I am the owner and founder of Iconic Templates. We are a template-based platform for WordPress. It mainly came from me being an advocate and a user of other people’s templates for years, starting my journey, I would say, back in 2008. So, I’m no WordPress &#8220;old-schooler&#8221; as I call it, like the people who came in way before me. But I definitely love the fact that WordPress has given me opportunities, flexibility, and new lessons as far as community and developing websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Alright, so what is your accessibility angle, just to put you on the spot?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />When it comes to e-commerce and accessibility, I would say I am a newbie on the cusp of becoming an intermediate person. For me, accessibility is still an ocean of wonders and questions. I’m not a technical person in terms of development, and what I’ve learned about accessibility has a lot to do with development practices and design practices as well. I’m neither a designer nor a developer, so my experience is more relatable to the average person. But what I’ve learned is the importance and necessity of accessibility, because there are many more people in the world who I assumed could access websites, but they can’t because of various disabilities or disadvantages. So, I’m learning. I’m a work in progress, but I’ve learned a lot so far. In the e-commerce world, especially, it’s critical—because people can’t buy what they can’t see. If they can’t access your website or experience it in certain ways, how can you expect them to purchase your product?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />And it’s not just about seeing, right? It’s always interesting that accessibility is thought of as something for people who are blind, but the group of people affected is so much larger. You’re missing out on a ton of conversions if your website is filled with sliders and moving elements. Accessibility as an important part of your conversion strategy is something people tend to forget. And I know you like to look at things from a larger perspective. I find it interesting that you don’t have a development background, because that’s important for everyone to know, especially when creating websites. I mean, WordPress enables us to install WooCommerce and create a webshop without knowing what we’re doing. In a sense, it guides us, which is wonderful. But if you’re working at a professional level, you have to understand—just like with bookkeeping—you don’t have to know how to do your own bookkeeping, but you need to be able to read the numbers. So, I’m challenging you here. This is what we call &#8220;shooting at an open goal.&#8221; Now, if there are conversion advantages to accessibility, especially in e-commerce, what advantages do you see? Can you expand on that? And I have the same question for Bob, actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yeah, I’ll start with this: The reason I didn’t mention conversions is that I always try to speak to a C-level grade student audience. I consider myself a C-level student. And when I start using big words, people start asking more questions, and they get confused. So, I like to come up with little metaphors, similes, or simple ways to explain things that the average person can understand. Then I give them the &#8220;juice,&#8221; as we say. So yes, you&#8217;re absolutely right. It is about conversions. For example, if you have a button on your website that’s a certain color or it’s developed in a way that makes it jittery or weird, it can make it hard for someone to commit to moving forward to the next step, whether that’s a sale, a subscription, or joining your email list. So, in my opinion, that’s one example of how accessibility can affect conversions—using buttons. As far as I know, links and buttons are what move us forward to the next step on the journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Links and buttons—those are an interesting topic. I’ll keep a mental note to get back to that. Bob, what about you? What does accessibility in e-commerce mean to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BobWP:<br />Well, I agree a lot with what Maestro said. It’s interesting because I think about accessibility and wonder where we draw the line. I’ll give you an example. Today I was on a site ordering something. When I got to the checkout and entered my address, it gave me two lines—one for the first part of the address and one for the second part. Our address is quite long, and when I hit &#8220;next step,&#8221; it moved the second part of the address onto the first line, saying, “Your address is limited to 34 characters.” So, I had to think, “How can I adjust this to make it deliverable?” And while that might be more of a technical issue with the checkout form, it made me think about accessibility—this was frustrating to me, and I can see and think through the problem. But what kind of issues would this pose for others? It’s strange—these little things can create big problems. For instance, I get vertigo sometimes, and scrolling can be tough for me. But if something comes on the screen with wiggly or strange movements because someone is trying to be clever, it becomes challenging. So, yeah, it’s a constant challenge for far more people than we might imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah, this is so true. Unfortunately, these issues are hard to measure when talking to companies. Whether it’s in the U.S., where they need to be compliant, or here in Europe, where the European Accessibility Act is going to hit like a tsunami, it’s important to understand. You are naming examples here, and they’re hard to measure. Companies complain that they pay SEO specialists thousands every month, and they celebrate when their click rate increases by half a percent. But at some point, they’ll notice that conversions are failing or bounce rates are high. You can spend all the money you want on SEO, but you’ll still have unexplained bounces if your website isn&#8217;t accessible. You can’t measure assistive technology usage—that would be an incredible breach of privacy. This is always a tough discussion between shop owners and companies that need to make their shops accessible. They want numbers, but common sense should also play a role. If you&#8217;re working on a webshop, whether you&#8217;re a developer or not, you need to understand basic things—like buttons and links. Few people outside of coding know that a button does something and a link goes somewhere. People like to wrap links in buttons that look like buttons. In hardcore accessibility circles, people will say, “Don’t do that,” but we’re talking about inclusion here, and everyone should be included, not just people who rely on assistive technology. We are all sensitive to certain stimuli, and we can all benefit from accessibility features. Have you ever tried turning your screen to black and white on your iPhone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yes! To your point, I’ve noticed a trend where people are becoming more conscious of these things. In email templates, for instance, you can’t control the email client—whether it’s Gmail or Yahoo (does anyone still use Yahoo? I’m sure someone does!). And it’s interesting that with Apple’s iOS updates, they&#8217;re allowing users to change the gradients on icons. But when it comes to color changes, I’ve noticed that people who are accessibility-conscious will often change the default link color from blue to something more legible in dark mode, for example. Chrome, Safari, and other browsers all handle accessibility in their own ways, but they don’t always follow the same rulebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Doesn’t that scare you a little?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yes! It’s both fascinating and scary. There are certain things you just can’t control. But what can you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />And going back to Bob’s example about the form—this is where UI and UX go hand in hand. People say you can’t make beautiful accessible websites, which is nonsense. But something practical like a form—I love it when a form is coded so it asks, “Do you want to autofill this?” That’s not just helpful for jittery users—it’s helpful for everyone. Accessibility is primarily intended for people who use assistive technology, but then it helps everyone else too. And it’s interesting to see how page builders and themes handle this. Some of them are like, “Hey, look at this beautiful form widget,” but wouldn&#8217;t it be great if you didn’t have to worry whether the browser will offer autofill options?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Yes, and I’ve seen this a lot, especially with email templates. Different email clients handle accessibility differently, and it’s the same with browsers. But going back to your point—there are so many things we can’t control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Yeah, it’s like when you’re working with page builders or themes, and they offer these forms that look great, but are they accessible? You need to test that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Exactly. And this goes back to how accessibility affects conversions. If people can’t use your forms, how can they complete their purchase? It’s all connected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Absolutely. So, we’ve covered a lot of ground here. Do you have any final thoughts, Maestro, before we wrap up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Just that accessibility is a journey. I’m still learning, and I hope to continue improving. It’s important for everyone to start somewhere, and we can all make a difference by making our websites more accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne:<br />Thank you so much for joining us today, Maestro. It was a pleasure having you on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro:<br />Thank you for having me. It was a pleasure.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode of the <strong>All Things WordPress and WooCommerce</strong>, hosts <strong>Anne</strong> and BobWP are joined by <strong>Maestro Stevens</strong>, founder of <strong>Iconic Templates</strong>, as he shares his journey of learning accessibility for the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, they dive into the challenges, opportunities, and strategies for making online stores more accessible, not just for compliance but to improve conversions and user experience for everyone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re new to accessibility or looking for ways to integrate it into your WordPress projects, this conversation offers valuable insights, practical tips, and reflections from professionals in the process of learning and implementing accessible web practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility is for Everyone</strong>: Accessibility isn’t just about making websites usable for people with visual impairments—it benefits everyone, including those with cognitive, physical, and situational challenges. Making a site accessible improves the overall user experience and helps more people engage with your content or products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Accessibility and Conversions</strong>: A key point in the discussion was that accessibility directly impacts conversions, especially in e-commerce. If users can&#8217;t navigate your site or interact with elements like buttons or forms, they can’t complete transactions. Accessible design helps remove barriers, ensuring that all users can take the desired actions, such as making purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Growing Awareness in WordPress</strong>: Both Maestro and Anne discussed the growing importance of accessibility in the WordPress and WooCommerce communities. WordPress is actively developing more accessible features, and WooCommerce is improving accessibility in product creation and checkout experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learning is a Journey</strong>: <strong>Maestro</strong> shared that he’s still learning about accessibility and how to incorporate it into his projects. This is an important reminder that it’s okay to start small and grow your knowledge over time. Tools like the <strong>Accessibility Checker</strong> plugin can help identify areas for improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Collaboration and Communication are Key</strong>: When making websites more accessible, collaboration between developers, designers, and clients is essential. Clear communication about the importance of accessibility can help shift mindsets and lead to better results. Approaching accessibility with respect and consideration encourages progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Role of Assistive Technology</strong>: Assistive technology is critical for people with disabilities, but there’s no easy way to measure how many people use it on your website. As Anne pointed out, some things like form autofill or visual simplicity can help many users, even those who don’t rely on assistive tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>: As the conversation highlighted, accessibility is not a one-time task but an ongoing process. Regularly updating your website with accessibility in mind ensures that it remains usable for all visitors, including those with different abilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://iconictemplates.com\">Iconic Templates</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maestrostevens/\">Maestro on LinkedIn</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://equalizedigital.com/accessibility-checker\">Accessibility Checker by Equalize Digital</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 14:22:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"Akismet: Demand Generation vs Lead Generation — Use Both to Grow Customers and Revenue\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://akismet.com/?p=284132\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://akismet.com/blog/demand-generation-vs-lead-generation/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18475:\"<p>To make a customer, you first have to <em>attract</em> potential customers. But if all you ever do is <em>attract</em> them, and not engage and sell to them, your company won’t grow fast enough. This is why, when you hear about demand generation vs lead generation, your reaction should be that you need both, not one or the&nbsp;other.</p>\n\n\n<p>Neglect either one of these, and your revenue will eventually feel the effects. You’ll either shrink your pool of qualified leads and potential customers, or you’ll fail to convert as many as you should have the ones you have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, both lead generation and demand generation play huge roles in business growth. You need to commit to and succeed in both if you want to see sustained revenue increases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a look at each&nbsp;concept.</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-284132\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is demand&nbsp;generation?</h2>\n\n\n<p>Demand generation focuses on attracting new potential customers. In funnel speak, the focus here is on top-of-funnel marketing. You’re creating interest and curiosity about your products and services. You’re making people lean in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>When we talk about how marketing is about getting attention amid the intense competition and chaos of the digital world, we’re talking about demand generation. Getting noticed. Being memorable. Becoming part of the conversation in people’s&nbsp;minds.</p>\n\n\n<p>“Did you hear about….” is a demand generation question asked by someone who was successfully marketed to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"key-components-of-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key components of demand&nbsp;generation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Demand generation refers to any type of marketing whose objective is to gain attention, interest, or curiosity. You’ll ask people to do things like click, read, open, watch, and comment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your goal is to position a product, service, or brand as something positive, helpful, useful, or trustworthy in your particular industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Demand generation marketing could&nbsp;be:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Helpful</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Informative</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Memorable</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trust-building</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Educational&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Free</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Easily-accessible</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll use tactics such as social media marketing, influencer marketing, email campaigns that aren’t directly selling, giveaways, webinars, and free content. Larger companies might also use legacy media channels like TV and radio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-role-of-demand-generation-in-the-buyerâs journey\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The role of demand generation in the buyer’s&nbsp;journey</h3>\n\n<p>Not every potential customer is ready to buy right now. But if you’ve done effective demand generation marketing, when the time comes for them to buy, your company or product will be at the top of their&nbsp;mind.</p>\n\n\n<p>At the top of the sales funnel, people are just shopping around. They’re not ready to make decisions. They’re not ready to fill out forms, sign up for consultations, or give you their contact information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demand generation marketing engages people who aren’t even looking, and those who are looking but aren’t necessarily that serious about it yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a customer may be happy with their current car insurance. But they know they’re planning to buy a new car in the next couple of years, and when they do, they might take a fresh look at their insurance. Demand generation marketing gives them a direction to go when that time comes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"kpis-and-measurement-of-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">KPIs and measurement of demand&nbsp;generation</h3>\n\n<p>Demand generation marketing, broadly speaking, gets measured with broad metrics. You’re focusing here on reach more than&nbsp;engagement.</p>\n\n\n<p>That means things like visibility, social mentions and shares, opens, click-through rates, and webpage traffic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-lead generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is lead&nbsp;generation?</h2>\n\n\n<p>While demand generation is about creating desire, spurring positive feelings, and being remembered, lead generation is about inspiring action. With demand generation, no one has to commit to anything. With lead generation, someone is going to call you or fill out a form — and you’re expecting them to do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we’ve moved down the funnel a bit. Desire has grown, and the motivation to act, engage, and possibly buy has taken over. Now, the lead is thinking, “I need this, or I want this, and maybe this is the direction to go.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve got their attention. Now, you’re converting that attention into something you hope results in a sale.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"key-components-of-lead generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key components of lead&nbsp;generation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation refers to any type of marketing whose objective is to collect customer data, initiate follow-up, nurture a relationship, actively engage with prospects, or make an offer and complete a sale. You’ll be asking potential customers to do things like sign up, join, request, try a sample, start a free trial, or make a purchase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation always comes with some sort of offer, and usually that’s in exchange for their contact information. This is the goal — to obtain their information so you can follow up and pursue the relationship and an eventual&nbsp;sale.</p>\n\n<p>Lead generation marketing could&nbsp;be:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Direct</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Specific</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Helpful</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Empowering</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Solution-oriented</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offer-driven</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Urgent</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>Media for lead generation marketing can overlap quite a bit with demand generation media, but it’s more in how you use it. You can use social media, but the call to action will be more specific than “learn&nbsp;more.”</p>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation tends to be much more effective when done with the help of marketing automation. With automation, you can develop follow-up processes and sequences that you can track for people at all sorts of stages in their customer journeys.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Lead&#8209;gen marketing uses assets like landing pages, paid ads, live chat, and lead magnet tools like white papers, eBooks, free trials, and time&#8209;limited coupons and discounts for new&nbsp;customers.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Minimize friction at conversion points by reducing the number of fields that prospects must fill out. The quickest way to boost your results is to eliminate CAPTCHAs and other anti-spam checks. Instead, <a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">use Akismet</a> to block 99.99% of spam without interrupting the user experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"732\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.png\" alt=\"Akismet homepage with the text \" />\n\n\n<h3 id=\"the-role-of-lead-generation-in-the-buyerâs journey\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">The role of lead generation in the buyer’s&nbsp;journey</h3>\n\n\n<p>With lead generation, you’re requiring a decision that carries some sort of consequence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prospect thinks, “Either I engage with this, and then I can expect certain things to follow, or I can choose not to engage.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lead generation presumes a pre-existing level of interest. If someone complains about being “sold” by your marketing, in the negative sense, that simply means this person hasn’t yet experienced enough of your demand marketing. You’re pushing them too far, too early. They aren’t ready to give you their contact information. They feel “pressured.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a potential customer who knows what they need, knows what they’re looking for, and wants to find a good solution won’t respond to lead generation marketing like that at all. They want it. They want helpful content, answers, customer service, and the opportunity to move forward with someone they believe can help.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"kpis-and-measurement-of-lead generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">KPIs and measurement of lead&nbsp;generation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation gets measured by the sorts of metrics you can more directly link to revenue. This includes things like signups, responses, quote forms filled out, demos requested, free trials started, and conversions. Other lead generation metrics include cost per lead and lead response time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these metrics lead to money. More signups mean more sales. Lower lead response time means more leads engaged more efficiently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"key-differences-between-demand-and-lead generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key differences between demand and lead&nbsp;generation</h2>\n\n<p>As you’ve probably picked up already, while some overlap exists between demand generation and lead generation, these are very different types of marketing. Let’s explore the differences in more&nbsp;detail.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"core-focus-and purpose\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core focus and&nbsp;purpose</h3>\n\n\n<p>Demand generation marketing focuses on building an audience. When this type of marketing has worked, if you speak, people listen. If you make an announcement, people pay attention. You have their trust, or at least their awareness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Lead generation marketing works at converting the audience you’ve already built through demand generation. If you have 100,000 people who have expressed or felt some level of interest, how many of those can you motivate to give their contact information or request your lead magnet offer? That’s the question lead generation marketing is&nbsp;answering.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"780\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image.png\" alt=\"WPVIP lead capture form\" class=\"wp-image-284134\" />\n\n\n<h3 id=\"timing-and-stage-in-the-buyerâs journey\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Timing and stage in the buyer’s&nbsp;journey</h3>\n\n\n<p>The timing of both of these types of marketing can vary dramatically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On one hand, this can all happen in a single session with a new lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suppose a person already knows they need something you sell, but they haven’t acted on it yet. This person could be called a “warm unknown prospect.” Maybe they’re the type of person who makes fast decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This person sees a post on social media. Their interest is piqued because they’ve already been thinking about something they need related to the content of the post. So, they engage with the post by clicking on it, which takes them to an article on your site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>From there, they explore your site, look at your products, and then come across a lead magnet offer for a 30&#8209;day coupon for new customers. They sign up. Now, the clock is ticking. In less than 30 days, this person could travel through all stages of the buying journey and make a purchase, becoming a&nbsp;customer.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, it could go even faster than that. They could make a purchase the same&nbsp;day.</p>\n\n\n<p>However, the same process could be drawn out over months, even years, for another potential customer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some industries have shorter sales cycles, and others have longer ones. Sometimes, you continue to nurture and develop the relationship merely to sustain interest. During that time, you also continue to make lead generation offers. Some in your audience will act on those offers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"strategies-and tactics\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Strategies and&nbsp;tactics</h3>\n\n<p>Strategies for demand generation marketing include things&nbsp;like:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Attention&#8209;getting language or multimedia&nbsp;imagery</li>\n\n\n<li>Humor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trust-building content</li>\n\n\n<li>Low&#8209;stakes offers like reading reviews and consuming free&nbsp;content</li>\n\n<li>Consistent content and media&nbsp;presence</li>\n\n<li>Low or no&#8209;pressure&nbsp;content</li></ul>\n\n\n<p>Strategies for lead generation marketing include things&nbsp;like:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Targeted and measurable offers — including free&nbsp;ones</li>\n\n<li>Lead magnets that collect contact&nbsp;information</li>\n\n\n<li>Follow-up emails</li>\n\n\n<li>Demonstrations, consultations, free&nbsp;trials</li>\n\n<li>New customer discounts, promotions, and&nbsp;giveaways</li>\n\n<li>CTAs that demand a&nbsp;decision</li></ul>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"measurement-and metrics\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Measurement and&nbsp;metrics</h3>\n\n<p>When demand generation works, your audience grows with people who are open to becoming a lead. You’re not reaching out directly to them yet, but if you did, they’d be more likely to be&nbsp;responsive.</p>\n\n\n<p>When lead generation works, your engaged audience is ready to consider becoming a customer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You measure the metrics that support each of these outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demand generation gets measured with visibility, likes, opens, shares, web traffic, views, and seconds or minutes watched, for something like a webinar or a YouTube ad.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lead generation gets measured with form submissions, demos and consultations scheduled and attended, redeemed coupons, converted free trials, as well as the process-metrics like cost per lead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"why-you-need-both-lead-and-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why you need both lead and demand&nbsp;generation</h2>\n\n<p>You need both because each type of marketing fills missing gaps in the&nbsp;other.</p>\n\n<p>If all you do is demand generation, you’ll build an audience, but you won’t convert nearly as many of them into paying customers as you should have. If all you do is lead generation, you’ll have too small a pool to draw from, and will be constantly trying to attract new leads from people who’ve never heard of&nbsp;you.</p>\n\n\n<p>Generating leads from total strangers takes a lot more work and money than generating leads from people who are at least familiar with you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analogy would be like trying to irrigate a field with water from a trickling stream, rather than an abundant river.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Demand generation provides the river. Lead generation waters the field.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"faqs\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">FAQs</h2>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"can-lead-generation-work-without-prior-demand generation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can lead generation work without prior demand&nbsp;generation?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Yes, but it requires a lot more effort, and will usually produce a lot less revenue. With sufficiently targeted marketing, you can create leads from a cold audience. But that target audience, which has to be pre-existing, needs to already be large enough to generate enough quality leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-common-challenges-in-lead-generation-and-how-can-i-overcome them\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are common challenges in lead generation, and how can I overcome&nbsp;them?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Common challenges include not knowing where to look, not having sufficient follow-up marketing, and being timid in making or closing the sale — letting good leads languish on the vine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for knowing where to look, with demand generation marketing, you can build your own audience and then find leads from there. Other than that, look for pre-existing media where your audience already congregates, such as an industry event. Or, use targeted online advertising.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the follow-up problem, you want to create the plan before launching the lead gen campaign. Otherwise, you get a bunch of leads, but you miss the opportunity to convert them. Create a plan and a process for how you will contact your leads. Have a phone script. Have an email welcome series. Send them something in the mail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"876\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-1.png\" alt=\"Email from Dan-O\" class=\"wp-image-284135\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To inspire confidence in prospects to take action, you must first have confidence in your own ability to sell and the essential role your product or service will play in their lives. For larger companies, it takes a highly-trained sales team and a process that works, and that adapts to the needs of the moment for each prospect.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-can-akismet-help-in-improving-the-quality-of-my-lead-generation efforts\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can Akismet help in improving the quality of my lead generation&nbsp;efforts?</h3>\n\n<p>A big part of lead generation is online form submissions. And this is where you run into the annoying problem of bots and scammers filling out your <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/lead-generation-forms/\">lead generation forms</a>. To prevent this, many companies turn to CAPTCHA and other visual puzzles to verify people are humans. But this just passes on the annoyance to your leads. Making them solve puzzles doesn’t set them up to be converted into&nbsp;customers.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Akismet helps improve lead generation</a> by securing your forms from scammers without forcing your leads to slog through silly puzzles they can’t read and can barely see just to get a hold of your lead magnet or sign up for your free demo or consultation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No puzzles. No roadblocks. And, no spammers. Your forms just work, and it all happens in the background so no one even knows it’s a thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-types-of-companies-generally-use akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What types of companies generally use&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Over 100 million websites currently use Akismet, including<a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\"> enterprise clients</a> such as Microsoft, Bluehost, and ConvertKit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\">Here’s more about ConvertKit’s experience</a> with&nbsp;Akismet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"where-can-i-learn-more-about-integrating-akismet-with-my-marketing efforts\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where can I learn more about integrating Akismet with my marketing&nbsp;efforts?</h3>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\">Find out more</a> about how Akismet works in the background to create a zero-friction web form experience for your leads.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Sep 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: WordPress Training Team Seeks Ideas to Attract New Learners\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=160887\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-training-team-seeks-ideas-to-attract-new-learners\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1991:\"<p>The WordPress Training Team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2024/08/28/drawing-new-learners-to-the-new-learn-wordpress-org/\">currently seeking ideas and feedback</a> from the community to prioritize activities that will increase engagement with the newly <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2024/08/02/meet-the-new-learn-wordpress/\">revamped Learn WordPress platform</a> and attract new learners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored Kathryn Presner stated, “We want to have a steady flow of new learners discovering the site and taking advantage of the valuable resources it offers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She has outlined three types of potential activities that the Training Team is considering &#8211;  expanding marketing initiatives, increasing the Training Team’s visibility at WordCamps, and equipping learners and contributors with resources to promote Learn WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community members can go through the list of planned promotional activities, workshops, and events in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/2024/08/28/drawing-new-learners-to-the-new-learn-wordpress-org/\">Kathryn’s post</a>.

This becomes dangerous during elections, as it can be weaponized to trick voters.<br>“We need to push a little forward a talk about regulation. It is one thing for people to say that the opinion on the internet is fine, that people have different opinions, that we should just debate them,” he said.<br><br>“It is another thing for people to weaponize (deepfakes to spread) false information and to swing people to vote for specific candidates,” he added.<br>President Marcos fell victim to multiple deepfakes, allegedly produced by his political opponents, such as an audio in April where he supposedly ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines to act against China.<br>In July, the President was also the subject of another deepfake, with his face planted on the head of a man sniffing something that resembles an illegal substance.<br>Peixinho believes that without regulations, deepfakes could be exploited by some for hateful propaganda.<br><br>The US, which is holding presidential elections this year, is also working on rules regarding the use of deepfakes – and AI in general – for political campaigns.<br>For instance, a law in Colorado was passed requiring political candidates to declare whether they used AI in their ad materials.<br>The Philippines is said to be a hotbed for online disinformation during elections, particularly in 2022. This led Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, to erase more than five million pieces of content from these social media platforms for breaching community standards.<br>Some of the removed content incited violence against certain candidates, violating social media rules on hate speech, bullying and harassment.<br>The Interpol also warned the Philippine government about scams involving the sale of tickets for concerts to be held in Singapore in the remaining months of 2024.<br>Potential victims would “come across secondary listings of concert tickets for sale through online platforms such as Telegram, X, Facebook, Carousell and Xiaohongshu,” said a portion of Interpol’s “Purple Notice” shared with The STAR.<br>The scammers would then bring victims to other messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram and WeChat to continue their transactions.<br>“Victims would then be instructed to make payments for the tickets via bank transfer or gift cards (e.g., iTunes cards),” added the Interpol.<br>Eventually, scammers would either not deliver the tickets or send fake tickets.<br>The foreign body encouraged concertgoers to buy tickets from authorized ticketing agents and avoid third-party sellers, use secure payment methods and avoid advance payments and direct bank transfers.\n<!-- /wp:kubio/text -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/column -->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/column {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"7732_ax_YA\",\"_style\":{\"descendants\":{\"container\":{\"columnWidth\":{\"type\":\"custom\",\"custom\":{\"value\":50,\"unit\":\"%\"}}}}},\"hash\":\"dvP7Pj8HN\"}} -->\n<!-- wp:kubio/image {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"B3n5rLsK-\",\"hash\":\"XbGqPeRej\"},\"url\":\"http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/depfakes_2024-09-11_22-54-09.jpg\",\"id\":61,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/text {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"d023ePolG4\",\"hash\":\"gksFialAb\",\"style\":{\"descendants\":{\"text\":{\"textAlign\":\"left\"}}}}} -->\nAt a forum led by cybersecurity giant Trend Micro, Interpol head of cybercrime intelligence unit Ivo de Carvalho Peixinho said the country can consider introducing regulations against deepfakes now that the country will hold midterm polls next year.\n<!-- /wp:kubio/text -->\n\n<!-- wp:details {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":\"17px\"}}} -->\n<details class=\"wp-block-details\" style=\"font-size:17px\"><summary>➤ Causes and Contributing Factor</summary><!-- wp:paragraph {\"placeholder\":\"Type / to add a hidden block\"} -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/text {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"KMmhUwcFE_\",\"hash\":\"ZnskxVbwY\",\"style\":{\"descendants\":{\"text\":{\"textAlign\":\"justify\",\"typography\":{\"size\":{\"value\":17,\"unit\":\"px\"},\"family\":\"Mulish\"}}}}}} -->\nThe development of AI technologies, especially deep learning and generative models, has made it easier to create deepfakes.

This becomes dangerous during elections, as it can be weaponized to trick voters.<br>“We need to push a little forward a talk about regulation. It is one thing for people to say that the opinion on the internet is fine, that people have different opinions, that we should just debate them,” he said.<br><br>“It is another thing for people to weaponize (deepfakes to spread) false information and to swing people to vote for specific candidates,” he added.<br>President Marcos fell victim to multiple deepfakes, allegedly produced by his political opponents, such as an audio in April where he supposedly ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines to act against China.<br>In July, the President was also the subject of another deepfake, with his face planted on the head of a man sniffing something that resembles an illegal substance.<br>Peixinho believes that without regulations, deepfakes could be exploited by some for hateful propaganda.<br><br>The US, which is holding presidential elections this year, is also working on rules regarding the use of deepfakes – and AI in general – for political campaigns.<br>For instance, a law in Colorado was passed requiring political candidates to declare whether they used AI in their ad materials.<br>The Philippines is said to be a hotbed for online disinformation during elections, particularly in 2022. This led Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, to erase more than five million pieces of content from these social media platforms for breaching community standards.<br>Some of the removed content incited violence against certain candidates, violating social media rules on hate speech, bullying and harassment.<br>The Interpol also warned the Philippine government about scams involving the sale of tickets for concerts to be held in Singapore in the remaining months of 2024.<br>Potential victims would “come across secondary listings of concert tickets for sale through online platforms such as Telegram, X, Facebook, Carousell and Xiaohongshu,” said a portion of Interpol’s “Purple Notice” shared with The STAR.<br>The scammers would then bring victims to other messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram and WeChat to continue their transactions.<br>“Victims would then be instructed to make payments for the tickets via bank transfer or gift cards (e.g., iTunes cards),” added the Interpol.<br>Eventually, scammers would either not deliver the tickets or send fake tickets.<br>The foreign body encouraged concertgoers to buy tickets from authorized ticketing agents and avoid third-party sellers, use secure payment methods and avoid advance payments and direct bank transfers.\n<!-- /wp:kubio/text -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/column -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/row -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/section -->', 'Interpol: Expect deepfakes surge in 2025 Philippines elections', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '94-revision-v1', '', '', '2024-09-24 00:50:51', '2024-09-24 00:50:51', '', 94, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=98', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

This becomes dangerous during elections, as it can be weaponized to trick voters.<br>“We need to push a little forward a talk about regulation. It is one thing for people to say that the opinion on the internet is fine, that people have different opinions, that we should just debate them,” he said.<br><br>“It is another thing for people to weaponize (deepfakes to spread) false information and to swing people to vote for specific candidates,” he added.<br>President Marcos fell victim to multiple deepfakes, allegedly produced by his political opponents, such as an audio in April where he supposedly ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines to act against China.<br>In July, the President was also the subject of another deepfake, with his face planted on the head of a man sniffing something that resembles an illegal substance.<br>Peixinho believes that without regulations, deepfakes could be exploited by some for hateful propaganda.<br><br>The US, which is holding presidential elections this year, is also working on rules regarding the use of deepfakes – and AI in general – for political campaigns.<br>For instance, a law in Colorado was passed requiring political candidates to declare whether they used AI in their ad materials.<br>The Philippines is said to be a hotbed for online disinformation during elections, particularly in 2022. This led Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, to erase more than five million pieces of content from these social media platforms for breaching community standards.<br>Some of the removed content incited violence against certain candidates, violating social media rules on hate speech, bullying and harassment.<br>The Interpol also warned the Philippine government about scams involving the sale of tickets for concerts to be held in Singapore in the remaining months of 2024.<br>Potential victims would “come across secondary listings of concert tickets for sale through online platforms such as Telegram, X, Facebook, Carousell and Xiaohongshu,” said a portion of Interpol’s “Purple Notice” shared with The STAR.<br>The scammers would then bring victims to other messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram and WeChat to continue their transactions.<br>“Victims would then be instructed to make payments for the tickets via bank transfer or gift cards (e.g., iTunes cards),” added the Interpol.<br>Eventually, scammers would either not deliver the tickets or send fake tickets.<br>The foreign body encouraged concertgoers to buy tickets from authorized ticketing agents and avoid third-party sellers, use secure payment methods and avoid advance payments and direct bank transfers.\n<!-- /wp:kubio/text -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/column -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/row -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/section -->', 'Interpol: Expect deepfakes surge in 2025 Philippines elections', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '94-revision-v1', '', '', '2024-09-24 00:58:15', '2024-09-24 00:58:15', '', 94, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=101', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

This becomes dangerous during elections, as it can be weaponized to trick voters.<br>“We need to push a little forward a talk about regulation. It is one thing for people to say that the opinion on the internet is fine, that people have different opinions, that we should just debate them,” he said.<br><br>“It is another thing for people to weaponize (deepfakes to spread) false information and to swing people to vote for specific candidates,” he added.<br>President Marcos fell victim to multiple deepfakes, allegedly produced by his political opponents, such as an audio in April where he supposedly ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines to act against China.<br>In July, the President was also the subject of another deepfake, with his face planted on the head of a man sniffing something that resembles an illegal substance.<br>Peixinho believes that without regulations, deepfakes could be exploited by some for hateful propaganda.<br><br>The US, which is holding presidential elections this year, is also working on rules regarding the use of deepfakes – and AI in general – for political campaigns.<br>For instance, a law in Colorado was passed requiring political candidates to declare whether they used AI in their ad materials.<br>The Philippines is said to be a hotbed for online disinformation during elections, particularly in 2022. This led Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, to erase more than five million pieces of content from these social media platforms for breaching community standards.<br>Some of the removed content incited violence against certain candidates, violating social media rules on hate speech, bullying and harassment.<br>The Interpol also warned the Philippine government about scams involving the sale of tickets for concerts to be held in Singapore in the remaining months of 2024.<br>Potential victims would “come across secondary listings of concert tickets for sale through online platforms such as Telegram, X, Facebook, Carousell and Xiaohongshu,” said a portion of Interpol’s “Purple Notice” shared with The STAR.<br>The scammers would then bring victims to other messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram and WeChat to continue their transactions.<br>“Victims would then be instructed to make payments for the tickets via bank transfer or gift cards (e.g., iTunes cards),” added the Interpol.<br>Eventually, scammers would either not deliver the tickets or send fake tickets.<br>The foreign body encouraged concertgoers to buy tickets from authorized ticketing agents and avoid third-party sellers, use secure payment methods and avoid advance payments and direct bank transfers.\n<!-- /wp:kubio/text -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/column -->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/column {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"7732_ax_YA\",\"_style\":{\"descendants\":{\"container\":{\"columnWidth\":{\"type\":\"custom\",\"custom\":{\"value\":50,\"unit\":\"%\"}}}}},\"hash\":\"dvP7Pj8HN\"}} -->\n<!-- wp:kubio/image {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"B3n5rLsK-\",\"hash\":\"XbGqPeRej\"},\"url\":\"http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/depfakes_2024-09-11_22-54-09.jpg\",\"id\":61,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/text {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"d023ePolG4\",\"hash\":\"gksFialAb\",\"style\":{\"descendants\":{\"text\":{\"textAlign\":\"left\"}}}}} -->\nAt a forum led by cybersecurity giant Trend Micro, Interpol head of cybercrime intelligence unit Ivo de Carvalho Peixinho said the country can consider introducing regulations against deepfakes now that the country will hold midterm polls next year.\n<!-- /wp:kubio/text -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/column -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/row -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/section -->', 'Interpol: Expect deepfakes surge in 2025 Philippines elections', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '94-revision-v1', '', '', '2024-09-24 01:10:59', '2024-09-24 01:10:59', '', 94, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=104', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Ransomware and hacking incidents, including those involving the Department of Science and Technology, the Philippine National Police, and others, demonstrate a deliberate effort to steal data, disrupt services and cause anxiety among the public.<br>Since 2022, there has been a significant increase in these types of attacks, which are complemented by the spread of disinformation. The timing of these incidents is suspect since many of these events seem to coincide with developments in the West Philippine Sea and the Balikatan military exercises.<br>For its part, the government\'s response to these incidents has been consistent but reactive. At the policy level, the recent approval of the National Cyber Security Plan (2024-2028) signaled a strong commitment to address the country’s digital vulnerabilities.<br><br>In general, the NCSP provides a framework for public agencies on how to organize, respond, and sustain cybersecurity efforts. To further emphasize its urgency, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed Executive Order 58 mandating its adoption. The order established the National Cybersecurity Inter-Agency Committee to monitor and coordinate the implementation of the NCSP. <br>These actions are commendable and are important steps in the right direction. However, the Philippines is confronted with challenges that have compounded over the years and have created opportunities for criminals and state-sponsored malign actors.<br><br>For instance, the country’s fragmented and siloed approach to digitalization means that there is little collaboration and adoption of cyber standards, especially in the public sector.<br>Due to the need for transactional efficiency as mandated by previous laws and programs, security has become an afterthought and a victim of cost-cutting efforts.<br>Furthermore, government IT initiatives are often funded through agency-specific annual budgets. This means that agencies often lack the time to develop business cases and functional requirements that are crucial in collaboration and determining vulnerabilities. <br>This brings us to the penchant for fast solutions and stop-gap measures. The focus of this reactive practice is usually on emergency response and cyber forensics capabilities. There is also a misplaced emphasis on cost efficiency and techno-centric solutions. The standards of continuity, privacy, and security are the first ones to be thrown out of the window in this situation.<br><br>An alternative to this is the adoption of resilience strategies that can address digital vulnerabilities through proactive practices. To do this, one must be able to connect the dots, recognize the evolving nature of cyber threats, and implement holistic interventions.<br><strong>Connecting the dots</strong><br>The importance of connecting the dots in cybersecurity cannot be overstated. This effort requires collaboration between government agencies and the private sector to achieve common goals.<br>An example of this is the sharing of information on threat vectors and the exchange of expertise through internship programs. Furthermore, adherence to frameworks like the NIST 2.0 and ISO 27001/27002 will allow for the institutionalization of these practices and enhance organizational preparedness. These standards will also help government agencies define the digital competencies that are needed to strengthen cyber resilience.  <br><strong>Evolving nature of cyber threats</strong><br>It would be a tragedy if we are not able to recognize the convergence of offensive cyber incidents with disinformation operations. Usually perpetrated by state-sponsored actors, this phenomenon is often used as part of gray zone tactics.<br>It uses illegally obtained data for espionage and social engineering using artificial intelligence to create profiles intended to enhance audience targeting. This is done to ensure the efficacy of disinformation campaigns. It will not be difficult to imagine the use of stolen personal data from government agencies to establish patterns that can be used for malign influence operations.  <br><strong>A way forward </strong><br>Searching for a magic bullet to solve our cyber vulnerabilities is a futile and costly move. Quick solutions are tempting, but these temporary fixes will only result in the recurrence of these problems. <br>For this purpose, I believe that the country’s whole-of-society approach to cybersecurity is the best option. However, the question is, “How do we now operationalize this concept?” <br>To answer this question, I argue that a good starting point for this is to adopt a cyber resilience paradigm, which underscores the importance of collaboration, adherence to standards and mitigating emerging threats.<br>In addition, cyber resilience also views vulnerabilities and solutions at the level of the individual (citizens), the organization, and society.<br>Often described as cybersecurity’s weakest link, citizens are crucial in a cyber resilience strategy. The basic components of this level include the empowerment of individuals through awareness and cyber hygiene practices.

Ransomware and hacking incidents, including those involving the Department of Science and Technology, the Philippine National Police, and others, demonstrate a deliberate effort to steal data, disrupt services and cause anxiety among the public.<br>Since 2022, there has been a significant increase in these types of attacks, which are complemented by the spread of disinformation. The timing of these incidents is suspect since many of these events seem to coincide with developments in the West Philippine Sea and the Balikatan military exercises.<br>For its part, the government\'s response to these incidents has been consistent but reactive. At the policy level, the recent approval of the National Cyber Security Plan (2024-2028) signaled a strong commitment to address the country’s digital vulnerabilities.<br><br>In general, the NCSP provides a framework for public agencies on how to organize, respond, and sustain cybersecurity efforts. To further emphasize its urgency, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed Executive Order 58 mandating its adoption. The order established the National Cybersecurity Inter-Agency Committee to monitor and coordinate the implementation of the NCSP. <br>These actions are commendable and are important steps in the right direction. However, the Philippines is confronted with challenges that have compounded over the years and have created opportunities for criminals and state-sponsored malign actors.<br><br>For instance, the country’s fragmented and siloed approach to digitalization means that there is little collaboration and adoption of cyber standards, especially in the public sector.<br>Due to the need for transactional efficiency as mandated by previous laws and programs, security has become an afterthought and a victim of cost-cutting efforts.<br>Furthermore, government IT initiatives are often funded through agency-specific annual budgets. This means that agencies often lack the time to develop business cases and functional requirements that are crucial in collaboration and determining vulnerabilities. <br>This brings us to the penchant for fast solutions and stop-gap measures. The focus of this reactive practice is usually on emergency response and cyber forensics capabilities. There is also a misplaced emphasis on cost efficiency and techno-centric solutions. The standards of continuity, privacy, and security are the first ones to be thrown out of the window in this situation.<br><br>An alternative to this is the adoption of resilience strategies that can address digital vulnerabilities through proactive practices. To do this, one must be able to connect the dots, recognize the evolving nature of cyber threats, and implement holistic interventions.<br><strong>Connecting the dots</strong><br>The importance of connecting the dots in cybersecurity cannot be overstated. This effort requires collaboration between government agencies and the private sector to achieve common goals.<br>An example of this is the sharing of information on threat vectors and the exchange of expertise through internship programs. Furthermore, adherence to frameworks like the NIST 2.0 and ISO 27001/27002 will allow for the institutionalization of these practices and enhance organizational preparedness. These standards will also help government agencies define the digital competencies that are needed to strengthen cyber resilience.  <br><strong>Evolving nature of cyber threats</strong><br>It would be a tragedy if we are not able to recognize the convergence of offensive cyber incidents with disinformation operations. Usually perpetrated by state-sponsored actors, this phenomenon is often used as part of gray zone tactics.<br>It uses illegally obtained data for espionage and social engineering using artificial intelligence to create profiles intended to enhance audience targeting. This is done to ensure the efficacy of disinformation campaigns. It will not be difficult to imagine the use of stolen personal data from government agencies to establish patterns that can be used for malign influence operations.  <br><strong>A way forward </strong><br>Searching for a magic bullet to solve our cyber vulnerabilities is a futile and costly move. Quick solutions are tempting, but these temporary fixes will only result in the recurrence of these problems. <br>For this purpose, I believe that the country’s whole-of-society approach to cybersecurity is the best option. However, the question is, “How do we now operationalize this concept?” <br>To answer this question, I argue that a good starting point for this is to adopt a cyber resilience paradigm, which underscores the importance of collaboration, adherence to standards and mitigating emerging threats.<br>In addition, cyber resilience also views vulnerabilities and solutions at the level of the individual (citizens), the organization, and society.<br>Often described as cybersecurity’s weakest link, citizens are crucial in a cyber resilience strategy. The basic components of this level include the empowerment of individuals through awareness and cyber hygiene practices. In addition, the rampant spread of disinformation necessitates the development of critical thinking and digital literacy skills. <br>At the organizational level, giving equal priority to preparedness and continuity together with emergency response is paramount. Cyber preparedness is a proactive approach that requires organizations to determine its vulnerabilities. This can be done through risk assessments and audits.<br>For instance, the conduct of the data privacy impact assessment as mandated by the Data Privacy Act is a useful tool to establish security baselines.

Let us then heed the advice of authorities to refrain from clicking doubtful links or providing passwords or OTPs,” PhilHealth chief Emmanuel Ledesma, Jr. said.<br>PhilHealth earlier said that the ransomware attack did not affect the servers containing the private information of members. Only application servers and employees’ workstations were impacted.<br><br>The insurer also appealed to the public to refrain from circulating leaked data. Hackers may face up to 20 years of imprisonment, while individuals or organizations found downloading, processing or sharing the stolen data may also face criminal charges for unauthorized processing of personal information. <br>The National Privacy Commission earlier said it was investigating the potential negligence of PhilHealth.

This decisive action follows the unsettling revelation of a data breach where confidential information was illicitly obtained from PhilHealth\'s systems.<br>On October 6, 2023, the Complaints and Investigation Division of the NPC has completed its initial analysis of 650GB worth of compressed files originating from the data dump claimed by the Medusa group. Upon extraction, these files revealed a staggering 734GB worth of data, including personal and sensitive personal information. In light of these findings, the NPC has launched a sua sponte investigation to ascertain the full scope of this breach, identify the responsible officials, and recommend legal prosecution to the fullest extent permissible by law.<br>During a recent media interview, PhilHealth implicitly acknowledged a degree of negligence on their part, with one of their officials citing the expiration of antivirus software as a potential vulnerability that may have facilitated the breach. The NPC will leave no stone unturned in its investigation into the potential negligence of PhilHealth officials and explore whether any efforts have been made to conceal pertinent information.<br>In unequivocal terms, the NPC issues a stern warning to the public: Any individual or organization found to process, download, or share the exfiltrated data from PhilHealth will be held accountable for unauthorized processing of personal information and may face criminal charges.<br>Rest assured, the NPC stands firm in its resolve to combat any actions that contravene the Data Privacy Act of 2012, whether within government or private institutions. We pledge unwavering dedication to enforcing the necessary measures and will be relentless in holding those responsible fully accountable.\n<!-- /wp:kubio/text -->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/text {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"vIIC-SyoT\",\"hash\":\"XdJZsO9W2\",\"style\":{\"descendants\":{\"text\":{\"textAlign\":\"left\",\"typography\":{\"size\":{\"value\":17,\"unit\":\"px\"},\"family\":\"Mulish\",\"weight\":400}}}}}} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/column -->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/column {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"7732_ax_YA\",\"_style\":{\"descendants\":{\"container\":{\"columnWidth\":{\"type\":\"custom\",\"custom\":{\"value\":50,\"unit\":\"%\"}}}}},\"hash\":\"dvP7Pj8HN\"}} -->\n<!-- wp:kubio/image {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"B3n5rLsK-\",\"hash\":\"XbGqPeRej\"},\"url\":\"http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/depfakes_2024-09-11_22-54-09.jpg\",\"id\":61,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/text {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"d023ePolG4\",\"hash\":\"gksFialAb\",\"style\":{\"descendants\":{\"text\":{\"textAlign\":\"left\"}}}}} -->\nAt a forum led by cybersecurity giant Trend Micro, Interpol head of cybercrime intelligence unit Ivo de Carvalho Peixinho said the country can consider introducing regulations against deepfakes now that the country will hold midterm polls next year.\n<!-- /wp:kubio/text -->\n\n<!-- wp:details {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":\"17px\"}}} -->\n<details class=\"wp-block-details\" style=\"font-size:17px\"><summary>➤ Causes and Contributing Factor</summary><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/text {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"Bq8DaCgYGO\",\"hash\":\"_alSAgHiO\",\"style\":{\"descendants\":{\"text\":{\"typography\":{\"size\":{\"value\":17,\"unit\":\"px\"},\"family\":\"Mulish\"}}}}}} -->\nThe ransomware attack on PhilHealth suggests vulnerabilities in the organization\'s cybersecurity defenses, particularly in protecting employee workstations and application servers.<br>Employees may have unknowingly exposed their workstations to malicious software by clicking on phishing links or downloading suspicious files.\n<!-- /wp:kubio/text --></details>\n<!-- /wp:details -->\n\n<!-- wp:details {\"style\":{\"typography\":{\"fontSize\":\"17px\"}}} -->\n<details class=\"wp-block-details\" style=\"font-size:17px\"><summary>➤ Impact on the Population, Especially Students</summary><!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/text {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"DGZeVy-jug\",\"hash\":\"-NVIXwRuR\",\"style\":{\"descendants\":{\"text\":{\"typography\":{\"size\":{\"value\":17,\"unit\":\"px\"},\"family\":\"Mulish\"}}}}}} -->\nStudents, particularly those using PhilHealth services, are at risk of identity theft.

This becomes dangerous during elections, as it can be weaponized to trick voters.<br>“We need to push a little forward a talk about regulation. It is one thing for people to say that the opinion on the internet is fine, that people have different opinions, that we should just debate them,” he said.<br><br>“It is another thing for people to weaponize (deepfakes to spread) false information and to swing people to vote for specific candidates,” he added.<br>President Marcos fell victim to multiple deepfakes, allegedly produced by his political opponents, such as an audio in April where he supposedly ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines to act against China.<br>In July, the President was also the subject of another deepfake, with his face planted on the head of a man sniffing something that resembles an illegal substance.<br>Peixinho believes that without regulations, deepfakes could be exploited by some for hateful propaganda.<br><br>The US, which is holding presidential elections this year, is also working on rules regarding the use of deepfakes – and AI in general – for political campaigns.<br>For instance, a law in Colorado was passed requiring political candidates to declare whether they used AI in their ad materials.<br>The Philippines is said to be a hotbed for online disinformation during elections, particularly in 2022. This led Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, to erase more than five million pieces of content from these social media platforms for breaching community standards.<br>Some of the removed content incited violence against certain candidates, violating social media rules on hate speech, bullying and harassment.<br>The Interpol also warned the Philippine government about scams involving the sale of tickets for concerts to be held in Singapore in the remaining months of 2024.<br>Potential victims would “come across secondary listings of concert tickets for sale through online platforms such as Telegram, X, Facebook, Carousell and Xiaohongshu,” said a portion of Interpol’s “Purple Notice” shared with The STAR.<br>The scammers would then bring victims to other messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram and WeChat to continue their transactions.<br>“Victims would then be instructed to make payments for the tickets via bank transfer or gift cards (e.g., iTunes cards),” added the Interpol.<br>Eventually, scammers would either not deliver the tickets or send fake tickets.<br>The foreign body encouraged concertgoers to buy tickets from authorized ticketing agents and avoid third-party sellers, use secure payment methods and avoid advance payments and direct bank transfers.\n<!-- /wp:kubio/text -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/column -->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/column {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"7732_ax_YA\",\"_style\":{\"descendants\":{\"container\":{\"columnWidth\":{\"type\":\"custom\",\"custom\":{\"value\":50,\"unit\":\"%\"}}}}},\"hash\":\"dvP7Pj8HN\"}} -->\n<!-- wp:kubio/image {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"B3n5rLsK-\",\"hash\":\"XbGqPeRej\"},\"url\":\"http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/depfakes_2024-09-11_22-54-09.jpg\",\"id\":61,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/text {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"d023ePolG4\",\"hash\":\"gksFialAb\",\"style\":{\"descendants\":{\"text\":{\"textAlign\":\"left\"}}}}} -->\nAt a forum led by cybersecurity giant Trend Micro, Interpol head of cybercrime intelligence unit Ivo de Carvalho Peixinho said the country can consider introducing regulations against deepfakes now that the country will hold midterm polls next year.\n<!-- /wp:kubio/text -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/column -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/row -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/section -->', 'PhilHealth advises precaution after data theft, leakage', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '127-revision-v1', '', '', '2024-09-24 02:05:58', '2024-09-24 02:05:58', '', 127, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=128', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Let us then heed the advice of authorities to refrain from clicking doubtful links or providing passwords or OTPs,” PhilHealth chief Emmanuel Ledesma, Jr. said.<br>PhilHealth earlier said that the ransomware attack did not affect the servers containing the private information of members. Only application servers and employees’ workstations were impacted.<br><br>The insurer also appealed to the public to refrain from circulating leaked data. Hackers may face up to 20 years of imprisonment, while individuals or organizations found downloading, processing or sharing the stolen data may also face criminal charges for unauthorized processing of personal information. <br>The National Privacy Commission earlier said it was investigating the potential negligence of PhilHealth.

Let us then heed the advice of authorities to refrain from clicking doubtful links or providing passwords or OTPs,” PhilHealth chief Emmanuel Ledesma, Jr. said.<br>PhilHealth earlier said that the ransomware attack did not affect the servers containing the private information of members. Only application servers and employees’ workstations were impacted.<br><br>The insurer also appealed to the public to refrain from circulating leaked data. Hackers may face up to 20 years of imprisonment, while individuals or organizations found downloading, processing or sharing the stolen data may also face criminal charges for unauthorized processing of personal information. <br>The National Privacy Commission earlier said it was investigating the potential negligence of PhilHealth. The agency said it is ready to face any inquiry.\n<!-- /wp:kubio/text -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/column -->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/column {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"7732_ax_YA\",\"_style\":{\"descendants\":{\"container\":{\"columnWidth\":{\"type\":\"custom\",\"custom\":{\"value\":50,\"unit\":\"%\"}}}}},\"hash\":\"dvP7Pj8HN\"}} -->\n<!-- wp:kubio/image {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"B3n5rLsK-\",\"hash\":\"XbGqPeRej\"},\"url\":\"http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/depfakes_2024-09-11_22-54-09.jpg\",\"id\":61,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\"} /-->\n\n<!-- wp:kubio/text {\"kubio\":{\"styleRef\":\"d023ePolG4\",\"hash\":\"gksFialAb\",\"style\":{\"descendants\":{\"text\":{\"textAlign\":\"left\"}}}}} -->\nAt a forum led by cybersecurity giant Trend Micro, Interpol head of cybercrime intelligence unit Ivo de Carvalho Peixinho said the country can consider introducing regulations against deepfakes now that the country will hold midterm polls next year.\n<!-- /wp:kubio/text -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/column -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/row -->\n<!-- /wp:kubio/section -->', 'PhilHealth advises precaution after data theft, leakage', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '127-revision-v1', '', '', '2024-09-24 02:11:34', '2024-09-24 02:11:34', '', 127, 'http://localhost/wordpress/?p=136', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This decisive action follows the unsettling revelation of a data breach where confidential information was illicitly obtained from PhilHealth\'s systems.<br>On October 6, 2023, the Complaints and Investigation Division of the NPC has completed its initial analysis of 650GB worth of compressed files originating from the data dump claimed by the Medusa group. Upon extraction, these files revealed a staggering 734GB worth of data, including personal and sensitive personal information.

The timing of these incidents is suspect since many of these events seem to coincide with developments in the West Philippine Sea and the Balikatan military exercises.<br>For its part, the government\'s response to these incidents has been consistent but reactive. At the policy level, the recent approval of the National Cyber Security Plan (2024-2028) signaled a strong commitment to address the country’s digital vulnerabilities.<br><br>In general, the NCSP provides a framework for public agencies on how to organize, respond, and sustain cybersecurity efforts. To further emphasize its urgency, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed Executive Order 58 mandating its adoption. The order established the National Cybersecurity Inter-Agency Committee to monitor and coordinate the implementation of the NCSP. <br>These actions are commendable and are important steps in the right direction. However, the Philippines is confronted with challenges that have compounded over the years and have created opportunities for criminals and state-sponsored malign actors.<br><br>For instance, the country’s fragmented and siloed approach to digitalization means that there is little collaboration and adoption of cyber standards, especially in the public sector.<br>Due to the need for transactional efficiency as mandated by previous laws and programs, security has become an afterthought and a victim of cost-cutting efforts.<br>Furthermore, government IT initiatives are often funded through agency-specific annual budgets. This means that agencies often lack the time to develop business cases and functional requirements that are crucial in collaboration and determining vulnerabilities. <br>This brings us to the penchant for fast solutions and stop-gap measures. The focus of this reactive practice is usually on emergency response and cyber forensics capabilities. There is also a misplaced emphasis on cost efficiency and techno-centric solutions. The standards of continuity, privacy, and security are the first ones to be thrown out of the window in this situation.<br><br>An alternative to this is the adoption of resilience strategies that can address digital vulnerabilities through proactive practices. To do this, one must be able to connect the dots, recognize the evolving nature of cyber threats, and implement holistic interventions.<br><strong>Connecting the dots</strong><br>The importance of connecting the dots in cybersecurity cannot be overstated. This effort requires collaboration between government agencies and the private sector to achieve common goals.<br>An example of this is the sharing of information on threat vectors and the exchange of expertise through internship programs. Furthermore, adherence to frameworks like the NIST 2.0 and ISO 27001/27002 will allow for the institutionalization of these practices and enhance organizational preparedness. These standards will also help government agencies define the digital competencies that are needed to strengthen cyber resilience.  <br><strong>Evolving nature of cyber threats</strong><br>It would be a tragedy if we are not able to recognize the convergence of offensive cyber incidents with disinformation operations. Usually perpetrated by state-sponsored actors, this phenomenon is often used as part of gray zone tactics.<br>It uses illegally obtained data for espionage and social engineering using artificial intelligence to create profiles intended to enhance audience targeting. This is done to ensure the efficacy of disinformation campaigns. It will not be difficult to imagine the use of stolen personal data from government agencies to establish patterns that can be used for malign influence operations.  <br><strong>A way forward </strong><br>Searching for a magic bullet to solve our cyber vulnerabilities is a futile and costly move. Quick solutions are tempting, but these temporary fixes will only result in the recurrence of these problems. <br>For this purpose, I believe that the country’s whole-of-society approach to cybersecurity is the best option. However, the question is, “How do we now operationalize this concept?” <br>To answer this question, I argue that a good starting point for this is to adopt a cyber resilience paradigm, which underscores the importance of collaboration, adherence to standards and mitigating emerging threats.<br>In addition, cyber resilience also views vulnerabilities and solutions at the level of the individual (citizens), the organization, and society.<br>Often described as cybersecurity’s weakest link, citizens are crucial in a cyber resilience strategy. The basic components of this level include the empowerment of individuals through awareness and cyber hygiene practices. In addition, the rampant spread of disinformation necessitates the development of critical thinking and digital literacy skills. <br>At the organizational level, giving equal priority to preparedness and continuity together with emergency response is paramount. Cyber preparedness is a proactive approach that requires organizations to determine its vulnerabilities. This can be done through risk assessments and audits.<br>For instance, the conduct of the data privacy impact assessment as mandated by the Data Privacy Act is a useful tool to establish security baselines. The Civil Service Commission’s business continuity program combined with IT disaster recovery techniques is another valuable tool.<br>In addition, the creation of sector-specific collaborative spaces for the sharing of threat intelligence and best practices is another important facet of resilience. This can be accomplished by creating professional associations and venues that allow for the inclusion of other stakeholders. <br>Lastly, a societal level view of cyber resilience underscores the importance of adopting a holistic and broader view of cybersecurity. By using a national security lens, it views the current information environment as a contested space that malign actors will continuously exploit.<br>Therefore, it is crucial for the country to identify its critical sectors and strengthen its resilience posture. Furthermore, the Philippines needs to leverage its international alliances to enhance its capabilities, learn from best practices, and ensure the timely exchange of threat information.<br>Cyber resilience is a holistic approach that underscores the importance of protecting the individual, the organization, and society. It is a proactive technique that emphasizes the importance of preparedness, continuity, and collaboration among others. Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet.

They can even last up to 10 years or more now, so quality has also evolved drastically. There’s no doubt that even with cloud storage now available, I think USBs are going to stick around for a long time,” Yeo said.<br>“But USBs are a boon to everyone who uses them, cyber criminals included, and a bane for those unaware that such offline hardware could cause a catastrophe. We need to understand that cyber attacks don’t come solely from the internet.
